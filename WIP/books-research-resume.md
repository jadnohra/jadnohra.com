# Books Research - Resume Context

## Task
Find notable books from TheNotes and 77-neurons repos, then decide where/how to add them to portfolio.

## Consolidated Findings (Both Repos)

### 77-neurons Project (2011-2012) - Structured Weekly Study

**Core curriculum books worked through chapter by chapter:**
1. **The Calculus Lifesaver** (Adrian Banner) — weeks 1-20
2. **Book of Proof** (Richard Hammack) — weeks 21-32
3. **Linear Algebra** (Jim Hefferon) — weeks 33-55

## Existing Books Section (portfolio.md line 759+)

```markdown
## Books

Favorite technical books studied throughout career.

1. **[Statistics for Experimenters](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistics+for+Experimenters%3A+Design%2C+Innovation%2C+and+Discovery%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471718130)** (Box, Hunter, Hunter) — Design of experiments, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals

## Decision Needed

Options:
1. Expand the existing Books section with more entries
2. Create Study entries that reference books (like existing "2015 - Study: Foundations & Logic")
3. Both - key books in Books section, detailed study in Study entries

---

## Next Steps

1. ~~Run 77-neurons agent to find topology/Perelman books~~ DONE
2. ~~Decide on approach~~ DONE (Option 3: Both)
3. ~~Implement additions to portfolio.md~~ DONE

## Changes Made

**New timeline entry added (line 362):**
- 2011-2012 - Study: Mathematical Foundations — 77-neurons Project Perelman
- References: Calculus Lifesaver, Book of Proof, Hefferon's Linear Algebra

**Books section expanded (lines 772-776):**
- Linear Algebra (Hefferon) — with links to 77-neurons and TheNotes
- Book of Proof (Hammack)
- Linear Algebra Done Right (Axler) — with memo notes link
- Mathematical Thought (Morris Kline) — with notes link
- Euclid's Elements — with notes link
