          ],
          "explanation": "Latency has a floor set by physics: ~1μs for PCIe round-trip, ~1ms same-datacenter, ~100ms cross-continent.\nYou can't optimize below this — only amortize it. Every protocol that seems slow is usually paying for round-trips, not computation.\nThis is why batching exists everywhere: the cost is per-transaction, not per-byte."
