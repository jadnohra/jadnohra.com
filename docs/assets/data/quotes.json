Both systems \"worked\"; modern physics yielded nuclear energy, and Ptolemaic astronomy yielded predictions whose precision bowled over Tycho. The medieval astronomers manipulated their epicyclic symbols as modern physics mani- pulates Schroedinger's wave equations or Dirac's matrices, and it worked – though they knew nothing of gravity and elliptic orbits, believed in the dogma of circular motion, and had not the faintest idea why it worked.

This is probably an aftermath of the reaction against the animism of Aristotelian physics, where stones accelerated their fall because of their impatience to get home, and against a teleological world-view in which the purpose of the stars was to serve as chronometers for man's profit. From Galileo onward, \"final causes\" (or \"finality\" for short) were relegated into the realm of superstition, and mechanical cau- sality reigned supreme. In the mechanical universe of indivisible hard little atoms, causali- ty worked by impact, as on a billiard table; events were caused by the mechanical push of the past, not by any \"pull\" of the future. That is the reason why gravity and other forms of action-at-a-distance did not fit into the picture and were regarded with suspicion; why ethers and vortices had to be invented to replace that occult pull by a mechanical push. The mechanistic universe gradually disintegrated, but the mechanistic notion of causality survived until Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle proved its untenability. Today we know that on the sub-atomic level the fate of an electron or a whole atom is not deter- mined by its past. But this discovery has not led to any basically new departure in the phi- losophy of nature, only to a state of bewildered embarrassment, a further retreat of physics into a language of even more abstract symbolism. Yet if causality has broken down and events are not rigidly governed by the pushes and pressures of the past, may they not be influenced in some manner by the \"pull\" of the future – which is a manner of saying that \"purpose\" may be a concrete physical factor in the evolution of the universe, both on the organic and unorganic levels. In the relativistic cosmos, gravitation is a result of the curva- tures and creases in space which continually tend to straighten themselves out – which, as Whittaker remarked, 27 \"is a statement so completely teleological that it would certainly have delighted the hearts of the schoolmen.\" (The sleepwalkers, Koestler)",

      "text": "Classical set theory accepts the notion of actual, completed infinities. However, some finitist philosophers of mathematics and constructivists object to the notion. If the positive number n becomes infinitely great, the expression 1/n goes to naught (or gets infinitely small). In this sense one speaks of the improper or potential infinite. In sharp and clear contrast the set just considered is a readily finished, locked infinite set, fixed in itself, containing infinitely many exactly defined elements (the natural numbers) none more and none less. (A. Fraenkel [4, p. 6]) Thus the conquest of actual infinity may be considered an expansion of our scientific horizon no less revolutionary than the Copernican system or than the theory of relativity, or even of quantum and nuclear physics. (A. Fraenkel [4, p. 245]) To look at the universe of all sets not as a fixed entity but as an entity capable of \"growing\", i.e., we are able to \"produce\" bigger and bigger sets. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p. 118]) (Brouwer) maintains that a veritable continuum which is not denumerable can be obtained as a medium of free development; that is to say, besides the points which exist (are ready) on account of their definition by laws, such as e, pi, etc. other points of the continuum are not ready but develop as so-called choice sequences. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p. 255]) Intuitionists reject the very notion of an arbitrary sequence of integers, as denoting something finished and definite as illegitimate. Such a sequence is considered to be a growing object only and not a finished one. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p. 236]) Until then, no one envisioned the possibility that infinities come in different sizes, and moreover, mathematicians had no use for “actual infinity.” The arguments using infinity, including the Differential Calculus of Newton and Leibniz, do not require the use of infinite sets. (T. Jech [3]) Owing to the gigantic simultaneous efforts of Frege, Dedekind and Cantor, the infinite was set on a throne and revelled in its total triumph. In its daring flight the infinite reached dizzying heights of success. (D. Hilbert [6, p. 169]) One of the most vigorous and fruitful branches of mathematics [...] a paradise created by Cantor from which nobody shall ever expel us [...] the most admirable blossom of the mathematical mind and altogether one of the outstanding achievements of man's purely intellectual activity. (D. Hilbert on set theory [6]) Finally, let us return to our original topic, and let us draw the conclusion from all our reflections on the infinite. The overall result is then: The infinite is nowhere realized. Neither is it present in nature nor is it admissible as a foundation of our rational thinking - a remarkable harmony between being and thinking. (D. Hilbert [6, 190]) Infinite totalities do not exist in any sense of the word (i.e., either really or ideally). More precisely, any mention, or purported mention, of infinite totalities is, literally, meaningless. (A. Robinson [10, p. 507]) Indeed, I think that there is a real need, in formalism and elsewhere, to link our understanding of mathematics with our understanding of the physical world. (A. Robinson) Georg Cantor's grand meta-narrative, Set Theory, created by him almost singlehandedly in the span of about fifteen years, resembles a piece of high art more than a scientific theory. (Y. Manin [4]) Thus, exquisite minimalism of expressive means is used by Cantor to achieve a sublime goal: understanding infinity, or rather infinity of infinities. (Y. Manin [5]) There is no actual infinity, that the Cantorians have forgotten and have been trapped by contradictions. (H. Poincaré [Les mathématiques et la logique III, Rev. métaphys. morale 14 (1906) p. 316]) When the objects of discussion are linguistic entities [...] then that collection of entities may vary as a result of discussion about them. A consequence of this is that the \"natural numbers\" of today are not the same as the \"natural numbers\" of yesterday. (D. Isles [6]) There are at least two different ways of looking at the numbers: as a completed infinity and as an incomplete infinity. (E. Nelson [7]) A viable and interesting alternative to regarding the numbers as a completed infinity, one that leads to great simplifications in some areas of mathematics and that has strong connections with problems of computational complexity. (E. Nelson [8]) During the renaissance, particularly with Bruno, actual infinity transfers from God to the world. The finite world models of contemporary science clearly show how this power of the idea of actual infinity has ceased with classical (modern) physics. Under this aspect, the inclusion of actual infinity into mathematics, which explicitly started with G. Cantor only towards the end of the last century, seems displeasing. Within the intellectual overall picture of our century ... actual infinity brings about an impression of anachronism. (P. Lorenzen[9])(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity)",

Until comparatively recent times, it was supposed that the geometrical theory expounded in the Elements of Euclid was an intellectual construction belonging to the realm of Platonic Ideas, and was unquestionably true. But there was no agreement as to the philosophical relation of the abstract theory to the universe of sensuous perception. Timaeus and Newton both asserted the existence of an entity 'space', in and through which is comprehended all experience of external nature; but while the space of Timaeus is invariably associated with matter and has no existence apart from it, the space of Newton is mostly vacant and is entirely distinct from the matter that moves within it. Timaeus's space is finite,f while Newton's is infinite. Moreover, Newton introduces the new concept of 'absolute position', i.e. he considers that the position of a body may be referred to 'absolute space', without reference to other bodies. Leibnitz vigorously criticized the Newtonian doctrine, and in the last year of his life (1716) expressed his own conviction thus: \\ '1 hold space to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions. For space denotes an order of things which exist at the same time, considered as existing together.' The peculiar excellence of this definition did not become fully manifest until the twentieth century, when the implications of the word coexistence were more closely examined. To say that two things are 'coexistent' means that they exist simultaneously. But as was first recognized in 1905^ if we consider two observers P and Q, who are in motion relative to each other, then it is possible that two events, which are witnessed by both of them, may be simultaneous according to P's system of reckoning, and yet not simultaneous according to Q's system of reckoning. Thus it follows from Leibnitz's definition that Pys instantaneous space is not identical with Q's instantaneous space: as is indeed the case, these spaces being different three-dimensional sections of four-dimensional space-time.\" (Whittaker, From Euclid to Eddington)",

But above all I wish to designate the following as the most important among the numerous questions which can be asked with regard to the axioms: To prove that they are not contradictory, that is, that a definite number of logical steps based upon them can never lead to contradictory results. In geometry, the proof of the compatibility of the axioms can be effected by constructing a suitable field of numbers, such that analogous relations between the numbers of this field correspond to the geometrical axioms. ... On the other hand a direct method is needed for the proof of the compatibility of the arithmetical axioms.\"[1]It is now common to interpret Hilbert's second question as asking in particular for a proof that Peano arithmetic is consistent.There are many known proofs that Peano arithmetic is consistent that can be carried out in strong systems such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. These do not provide a resolution to Hilbert's second question, however, because someone who doubts the consistency of Peano arithmetic is unlikely to accept the axioms of set theory (which is much stronger) to prove its consistency. Thus a satisfactory answer to Hilbert's problem must be carried out using principles that would be acceptable to someone who does not already believe PA is consistent. Such principles are often called finitistic because they are completely constructive and do not presuppose a completed infinity of natural numbers. Gödel's incompleteness theorem places a severe limit on how weak a finitistic system can be while still proving the consistency of Peano arithmetic.\" (wikipedia) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_second_problem)",

This inhalation of the unlimited was what, in Pythagorean thought, made it possible to describe the world in mathematical terms. Quoting Aristotle again, commenting on Philolaus’ teachings: The Pythagoreans, too, held that void exists, and that it enters the heaven from the unlimited breath it, so to speak, breathes in void. The void distinguishes the natures of things, since it is the thing that separates and distinguishes the successive terms in a series. This happens in the first case of numbers; for the void distinguishes their nature.\" \"About nature and harmony this is the position. The being of the objects, being eternal, and nature itself admit of divine, not human, knowledge except that it was not possible for any of the things that exist and are known by us to have come into being, without there existing the being of those things from which the universe was composed, the limited and the unlimited. And since these principles existed being neither alike nor of the same kind, it would have been impossible for them to be ordered into a universe if harmony had not supervened in whatever manner this came into being. Things that were alike and of the same kind had no need of harmony, but those that were unlike and not of the same kind and of unequal order it was necessary for such things to have been locked together by harmony, if they are to be held together in an ordered universe.\"\"A musical scale presupposes an unlimited continuum of pitches, which must be limited in some way in order for a scale to arise.

In fact, the solution of the problem must be a geometrical construction of the sought magnitude in terms of legitimate geometrical operations performed on the givens (‘Q.E.F.’!). We now have to move from algebra back to geometry again. Descartes understood this process from algebra to geometry as follows: the real roots of the equation (for him if there are no real roots, then the problem admits no solution) must be geometrically constructed. After Descartes, this process was known as the ‘construction of the equation’. This is where the synthetic, compositive part of the whole process begins. Descartes accepted from tradition the idea that such constructions must be per- formed by intersection of curves. That is to say, the real roots are geometrically represented by segments, and such segments are to be constructed by intersection of curves. As a matter of fact, the construction of the equation presented the geometer with a new problem: not always an easy one. One had to choose two curves, position and scale them, such that their intersections determine points from which segments – whose lengths geometrically represent the roots of the equation – can be drawn (see Figure 4).The synthetic part of Descartes’ process of problem-solving gave rise to two ques- tions: which curves are admissible in the construction of equations? which curves,among the admissible, are to be preferred in terms of simplicity? In asking him- self these questions Descartes was continuing a long debate concerning the role and classification of curves in the solution of problems. A tradition that, once again, stems from Pappus, and the interpretations of Pappus given by mathematicians such as Viète, Ghetaldi, Kepler, and Fermat. His answer was that only ‘geometrical curves’ (we would say ‘algebraic curves’) are admissible in the construction of the roots of equations and that one has to choose the curves of the lowest possible degree as these are the simplest.

      "text": "\"The major problems in algebra at the time (1770) that Lagrange wrote his fundamental memoir “Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations” concerned polynomial equations. There were “theoretical” questions dealing with the existence and nature of the roots (e.g., Does every equation have a root? How many roots are there? Are they real, complex, positive, negative?), and “practical” questions dealing with methods for finding` the roots. ln the latter instance there were exact methods and approximate methods. In what follows we mention exact methods. The Babylonians knew how to solve quadratic equations (essentially by the method of completing the square) around 1600 B.C. Algebraic methods for solving the cubic and the quartic were given around 1540. One of the major problems for the next two centuries was the algebraic solution of the quintic. This is the task Lagrange set for himself in his paper of 1770. In his paper Lagrange first analyzes the Various known methods (devised by F. Víète, R. Descartes, L. Euler, and E, Bézout) for solving cubic and quartíc equations. He shows that the common feature of these methods is the reduction of such equations to auxiliary equations-the so­called resolvent equations. The latter are one degree lower than the original equations. Next Lagrange attempts 21 similar analysis of polynomial equations of arbitrary degree 11. With each such equation he associates a “resolvent equation” as follows: let f (x) be the original equation, with roots xl, Pick a rationál function R(x1, xg, . . , , of the roots and coefficients of (Lagrange describes methods for doing so.) Consider the different values which R(x17 assumes under all the n! permutations of the roots of f(x). If these are denoted by then the resolvent equation is given by g(x) (x - yz) » (x - yk). (Lagrange shows that k divides n !-the source of what we call Lagrange’s theorem in group theory.) For example, if f(x) is a quartic with roots then R(x1, , X3, X4) may he taken to be XIX2 X3 X4, and this function assumes three distinct values under the 24 permutations of X1, X2, X3, X4. Thus the resolvent equation of a quartic is a cubic. However, in carrying over this analysis to the quintic, he finds that the resolvent equation is of degree six! Although Lagrange did not succeed in resolving the problem of the algebraic solvability of the quintic, his Work was a milestone. It was the first time that an association was made between the solutions of a polynomial equation and the permutations of its roots. In fact, the study of the permutations of the roots of an equation was a cornerstone of Lagrange’s general theory of algebraic equations. This, he speculated, formed “the true principles for the solution of equations.” (He was, of course, vindicated in this by E. Galois.) Although Lagrange speaks of permutations without considering a “calculus” of permutations (e.g., there is no consideration of their composition or closure), it can be said that the germ of the group concept (as a group of permutations) is present in his work, For details see [12], [16], [19], [25], [33].\" (The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey)",

At mid-century, a major problem had arisen, namely, the classification of the relations and inner connections among the different geometries and geometric methods. This gave rise to the study of “geometric relations,” focusing on the study of properties of figures invariant under transformations. Soon the focus shifted to a study of the transformations themselves. Thus the study of the geometric relations of figures became the study of the associated transformations.

Galois theory). Although Lie did not succeed in the actual formulation of a “Galois theory of differential equations,” his Work was fundamental in the subsequent formu- lation of such a theory by E. Picard (1883 / 1887) and E. Vessiot (1892). Poincaré and Klein began their work on “autornorphic functions” and the groups associated with them around 1876. Autornorphic functions (which are generalizations of the circular, hyperbolic, elliptic, and other functions of elementary analysis) are functions of a complex variable Z, analytic in some domain D, which are invariant under the group of transformations z'= ax + b / cx + d (a, b, C, d real or complex and ad » bc 0) or under some subgroup of this group, Moreover, the group in question must be “discontinuous” (i.c., any compact domain contains only finitcly many transforms of any point). Examples of such groups are the modular group (in which a, b, C, d are integers and ad » bc = 1), which is associated with the elliptic modular functions, and Fuchsian groups (in which a, b, C, d are real and ad - bc = 1) associated with the Fuchsian automorphic functions. As in the case of Klein’s Erlangen Program, we will explore the consequences of these works for group theory in section 2-(c).\" (The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey)",

Although the author states in the preface that “the aim of the work is to develop Galois’ method and to make it a proper field of study, by showing with what facility it can solve all principal problems of the theory of equations,” it is in fact group theory per se-not as an offshoot of the theory of solvability of equations~which forms the central object of study. The striving for a mathematical synthesis based on key ideas is a striking characteristic of J0rdan’s work as well as that of a number of other mathematicians of the peńod (e.g., F, Klein) The Concept of a (permutation) group seemed to Jordan to provide such a key idea. His approach enabled him to give a unified presentation of results due to Galois, Cauchy, and others. His application of the group concept to the theory of equations, algebraic geometry, transcendental functions, and theoretical mechanics was also part of the unifying and synthesizing theme. “In his book Jordan wandered through all of algebraic geometry, number theory, and function theory in search of interesting permutation groups” (Klein, [20]). In fact, the aim was a survey of all of mathematics by areas in which the theory of permutation groups had been applied or seemed likely to be applicable. “The work represents. . . a review of the whole of contemporary mathe- matics from the standpoint of the occurrence of group-theoretic thinking in permutation-theoretic form” (Wussing, [33]). The Traité embodied the substance of most of Iordan’s publications on groups up to that time (he wrote over 30 articles on groups during the period 18604880) and directed attention to a large number of difficult problems, introducing many fundamental concepts.\" (The Evolution of Group Theory: A Brief Survey)",

Once held as a monopoly of antiquarian historians of science and of pedantic epistemolo- gists, the problem of concept-formation in scientific theory gained vital importance and notable prominence in modern research. The study of the historical aspects of concept-formation in physical science is admittedly no easy task. In addition to a thorough historical and philological training, necessary for a skillful command of the source material, it requires comprehen- sion of physical theory, instrumental for the critical comparison and interpretation of the sources under discussion and indispen-sable for the evaluation of their significance for ssience as a whole. A serious difficulty in the study of the development of a scien- tific concept lies in the necessarily inherent vagueness of its defi- nition. This complication arises from the fact that the concept in question finds its strict specification only through its exact defini- tion in science. This definition, however, historically viewed, is a rather late and advanced stage in its development. To limit the discussion to the concept thus defined means to ignore a major part of its life history. The history of a concept has not yet run its course, it is true, even once it has achieved such a \"defined\" position, since it attains its complete meaning only through the ever-increasing and changing context of the conceptual structure in which it is placed. However, from the standpoint of the history of ideas, the most interesting and important part of its biography is passed, namely the period of its vigor and creative contribution to the advancement of scientific thought. When studying the de- velopment of a scientific concept one has, therefore, to cope with an essential vagueness of definition of the subject under discussion and one faces equally the danger of either drawing the limits too narrow or too wide.\" (Concepts of Force, Max Jammer)",

      "text": "\"As a result of modern research in physics, the ambition and hope, still cherished by most authorities of the last century, that physical science could offer a photographic picture and true image of reality had to be abandoned. Science, as understood today, has a more restricted objective: its two major assignments are the description of certain phenomena in the world of experience and the establishment of general principles for their prediction and what might be called their \"explanation.\" \"Explanation\" here means essentially their subsumption under these principles. For the efficient achievement of these two objectives science employs a conceptual apparatus, that is, a system of concepts and theories that represent or symbolize the data of sense experience, as pres- sures, colors, tones, odors, and their possible interrelations. This conceptual apparatus consists of two parts: (i) a system of concepts, definitions, axioms, and theorems, forming a hypo- thetico-deductive system, as exemplified in mathematics by Euclid- ean geometry; (2) a set of relations linking certain concepts of the hypothetico-deductive system with certain data of sensory experience. With the aid of these relations, which may be called \"rules of interpretation\" or \"epistemic correlations,\" x an associ- ation is set up, for instance, between a black patch on a photo- graphic plate (a sensory impression) and a spectral line of a certain wavelength (a conceptual element or construct2 of the hypothetico-deductive system), or between the click of an ampli- fier coupled to a Geiger counter and the passage of an electron. The necessity for physical science of possessing both parts as con- stituents results from its status as a theoretical system of propo- sitions about empirical phenomena. A hypothetico-deductive sys- tem without rules of interpretation degenerates into a speculative calculus incapable of being tested or verified; a system of epistemic correlations without a theoretical superstructure of a deductive system remains a sterile record of observational facts, devoid of any predictive or explanatory power. The adoption of rules of interpretation introduces, to some extent, an arbitrariness in the construction of the system as a whole by allowing for certain predilections in the choice of the concepts to be employed. In other words, arbitrary modifications in the formation of the conceptual counterparts to given sensory impressions can be compensated by appropriate changes in the epistemic correlations without necessarily destroying the corre- spondence with physical reality. In consequence of this arbitrari-ness, scientific concepts \"are free creations of the human mind and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world.\"3 When science attempts to construct a logically consistent sys- tem of thought corresponding to the chaotic diversity of sense experience, the selection of concepts as fundamental is not un- ambiguously determined by their suitability to form a basis for the derivation of observable facts. In the first place, some element of contingency is introduced by the somehow fortuitous sequence of experimentation and observation, an idea recently emphasized by James Bryant Conant: \"It seems clear that the development of our modern scientific ideas might have taken a somewhat dif- ferent course, if the chronological sequence of certain experimen- tal findings had been different. And to some degree, at least, this chronology can be regarded as purely accidental.\" * In the second place, a certain climate of opinion, conditioned by subconscious motives, is responsible to some extent for the specific character of the basic conceptions or primitive concepts. It is a major task of the historian of science to study this climate of opinion pre- vailing at a certain period and to expose the extrascientific ele- ments responsible for the finally accepted choice of those con- cepts that were to play a fundamental role in the construction of the contemporaneous conceptual apparatus. The history of sci- ence can often show in retrospect how alternative concepts have, or could have, been employed at the various stages in the devel- opment of the physical sciences in a provisionally satisfactory manner.\" (Concepts of Force, Max Jammer)",

      "text": "\"Physics theories of the late 19th century assumed that just as surface water waves must have an intervening substance, i.e. a \"medium\", to move across (in this case water), and audible sound requires a medium to transmit its wave motions (such as air or water), so light must also require a medium, the \"luminiferous aether\", to transmit its wave motions. Because light can travel through a vacuum, it was assumed that even a vacuum must be filled with aether. Since the speed of light is so great, and as material bodies pass through the aether without obvious friction or drag, the aether was assumed to have a highly unusual combination of properties. Designing experiments to test the properties of the aether was a high priority of 19th century physics.[A 4]:411ff Earth orbits around the Sun at a speed of around 30 km/s (18.75 mi/s) or over 108,000 km/hr (67,500 mi/hr). The Sun itself is travelling about the Galactic Center at an even greater speed, and there are other motions at higher levels of the structure of the universe. Since the Earth is in motion, two main possibilities were considered: (1) The aether is stationary and only partially dragged by Earth (proposed by Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1818), or (2) the aether is completely dragged by Earth and thus shares its motion at Earth's surface (proposed by George Gabriel Stokes in 1844).[A 5] In addition, James Clerk Maxwell (1865) recognized the electromagnetic nature of light and developed what are now called Maxwell's equations, but these equations were still interpreted as describing the motion of waves through an aether, whose state of motion was unknown. Eventually, Fresnel's idea of an (almost) stationary aether was preferred because it appeared to be confirmed by the Fizeau experiment (1851) and the aberration of light.[A 5] According to this hypothesis, Earth and the aether are in relative motion, implying that a so-called \"aether wind\" (Fig. 2) should exist. Although it would be possible, in theory, for the Earth's motion to match that of the aether at one moment in time, it was not possible for the Earth to remain at rest with respect to the aether at all times, because of the variation in both the direction and the speed of the motion. At any given point on the Earth's surface, the magnitude and direction of the wind would vary with time of day and season. By analysing the return speed of light in different directions at various different times, it was thought to be possible to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the aether. The expected relative difference in the measured speed of light was quite small, given that the velocity of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun was about one hundredth of one percent of the speed of light.[A 4]:417ff During the mid-19th century it was thought that it should be possible to measure aether wind effects of first order, i.e. effects proportional to v/c (v being Earth's velocity, c the speed of light). However, it was clear that a direct measurement of the speed of light was not possible with the accuracy required. For instance, the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5% accuracy, which was totally inadequate for measuring the direct, first order 0.01% change in the speed of light. Therefore, a number of physicists attempted to make measurements of indirect first order effects of light speed variations (see First order aether-drift experiments). For instance, the Hoek experiment intended to detect interferometric fringe shifts due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through resting water. But the results were all negative.[A 6] This could be explained by using Fresnel's dragging coefficient, according to which the aether and thus light is partially dragged by moving matter. Partial aether dragging would cancel out the ability to measure any first order change in the speed of light. As pointed out by Maxwell (1878), only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects would have any hope of detecting aether drift, i.e. effects proportional to v2/c2.[A 7][A 8] However, the required instrumental sensitivity was simply too great for existing experimental setups. Michelson had a solution to the problem of how to construct a device sufficiently accurate to detect aether flow. While teaching at his alma mater in 1877, the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Michelson conducted his first known light speed experiments as a part of a classroom demonstration. He left active U.S. Naval service in 1881 while he was in Germany concluding studies. In that year, Michelson used a prototype experimental device to make several more measurements. The device he designed, later known as a Michelson interferometer, sent yellow light from a sodium flame (for alignment), or white light (for the actual observations), through a half-silvered mirror that was used to split it into two beams travelling at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams travelled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal vs. the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a beam reflecting back and forth parallel to the flow of aether would take longer than a beam reflecting perpendicular to the aether because the time gained from traveling downwind is less than that lost traveling upwind. Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a fringe shift equal to 4% of the fringe separation. Michelson did not observe the expected 0.04 fringe shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes, while most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was to rule out Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging, confirming Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.[4] However, Alfred Potier (and later Hendrik Lorentz) pointed out to Michelson that he had made an error of calculation, and that the expected fringe shift should only have been 0.02 fringes. Thus, Michelson's apparatus had experimental errors far too large to say anything conclusive about the aether wind. For a definitive measurement of the aether wind, a much more accurate and tightly controlled experiment would have to be carried out. However, the prototype was successful in demonstrating that the basic method was feasible.[A 5][A 9]\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)",

The upper solid line is the curve for their observations at noon, and the lower solid line is that for their evening observations. Note that the theoretical curves and the observed curves are not plotted at the same scale: the dotted curves, in fact, represent only one-eighth of the theoretical displacements. After all this thought and preparation, the experiment became what has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.[A 13] Instead of providing insight into the properties of the aether, Michelson and Morley's article in the American Journal of Science reported the measurement to be as small as one-fortieth of the expected displacement (see Fig. 7), but \"since the displacement is proportional to the square of the velocity\" they concluded that the measured velocity was \"probably less than one-sixth\" of the expected velocity of the Earth's motion in orbit and \"certainly less than one-fourth.\"[1] Although this small \"velocity\" was measured, it was considered far too small to be used as evidence of speed relative to the aether, and it was understood to be within the range of an experimental error that would allow the speed to actually be zero.[A 1] (Afterward, Michelson and Morley ceased their aether drift measurements and started to use their newly developed technique to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length.[6][7]) From the standpoint of the then current aether models, the experimental results were conflicting. The Fizeau experiment and its 1886 repetition by Michelson and Morley apparently confirmed the stationary aether with partial aether dragging, and refuted complete aether dragging. On the other hand, the much more precise Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) apparently confirmed complete aether dragging and refuted the stationary aether.[A 5] In addition, the Michelson-Morley null result was further substantiated by the null results of other second-order experiments of different kind, namely the Trouton–Noble experiment (1903) and the Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902–1904). These problems and their solution led to the development of the Lorentz transformation and special relativity (see Fallout).\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)",

      "text": "\"Miller worked on increasingly larger interferometers, culminating in one with a 32 m (effective) arm length that he tried at various sites including on top of a mountain at the Mount Wilson observatory. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the sidereal day, and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately 10 km/s instead of the nearly 30 km/s expected from the Earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to partial entrainment or aether dragging, though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the Hammar experiment.[B 4][A 16] Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, Lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928.[A 17] There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate magnetostriction, while Michelson built one of non-expanding Invar to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller's results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out.[A 18] Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of creating apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller's original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller's apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)",

Because the light is detuned to the \"red\" (i.e. at lower frequency) of the transition, the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source, due to the Doppler effect. Thus if one applies light from two opposite directions, the atoms will always absorb more photons from the laser beam pointing opposite to their direction of motion. In each absorption event, the atom loses a momentum equal to the momentum of the photon. If the atom, which is now in the excited state, emits a photon spontaneously, it will be kicked by the same amount of momentum but in a random direction. The result of the absorption and emission process is a reduced speed of the atom, provided its initial speed is larger than the recoil velocity from scattering a single photon. If the absorption and emission are repeated many times, the mean velocity, and therefore the kinetic energy of the atom will be reduced. Since the temperature of an ensemble of atoms is a measure of the random internal kinetic energy, this is equivalent to cooling the atoms.The Doppler cooling limit is the minimum temperature achievable with Doppler cooling.Detailed ExplanationThe vast majority of photons that come anywhere near a particular atom are almost[1] completely unaffected by that atom. The atom is almost completely transparent to most frequencies (colors) of photons.A few photons happen to \"resonate\" with the atom, in a few very narrow bands of frequencies (a single color rather than a mixture like white light). When one of those photons comes close to the atom, the atom typically absorbs that photon (absorption spectrum) for a brief period of time, then emits an identical photon (emission spectrum) in some random, unpredictable direction.

      "text": "\"1.4 Une culture algébrique commune : l’équation séculaire Revenons à présent à la note de 1884 et à la question de la mise en relation des nombres complexes et des groupes continus. Nous avons déjà vu que cette mise en relation ne tient pas à l’identiﬁcation d’une notion uniﬁcatrice entre deux grandes théories. Elle s’appuie en revanche sur l’explicitation d’une identité en partie commune entre deux pratiques distinctes : la pratique des matrices de Sylvester et la pratique de réduction canonique utilisée par Poincaré. Nous allons à présent montrer que cette identité commune présente une di- mension collective qui dépasse les travaux de Sylvester et Poincaré. Elle relève en fait d’une culture algébrique largement partagée dans la seconde partie du XIXe siècle et qu’identiﬁe très précisément le titre du mémoire dans lequel Syl- vester développe, en 1883, la notion de racine latente d’une matrice : \"On the equation to the secular inequalities in the planetary theory\".[Sylvester, 1883] Ce titre reprend d’ailleurs celui d’un article publié par Sylvester en 1851 lorsque ce dernier a introduit le terme matrice : \"Sur l’équation à l’aide de laquelle on détermine les inégalités séculaires des planètes\".[Sylvester, 1852] De telles références à l’équation séculaire interviennent dans de très nom- breux textes du XIXe siècle. Elles ne manifestent le plus souvent pas de préoc- cupations en mécanique céleste mais s’avèrent la manière dont était identiﬁée une pratique algébrique commune entre études des cordes vibrantes et méca- nique céleste, systèmes diﬀérentiels et géométrie analytique, arithmétique des formes quadratiques et algèbre des invariants. C’est d’ailleurs dans ce cadre que les notions de matrices et de mineurs ont été introduites par Sylvester à la suite de travaux de Cauchy et ont par la suite circulé entre des travaux de Cayley, Sylvester, Hermite, Riemann etc. On trouve au cœur de cette pratique algébrique un procédé consistant à donner une expression polynomiale des solutions (xi ) d’un système linéaire sy- métrique de n équations par des quotients impliquant, outre le déterminant caractéristique S du système, ses mineurs successifs P1i obtenus par développe- ments par rapport à la 1re ligne et ie colonne. L’expression polynomiale donne P1i (∗) (x) S x−sj P1i s xi j = S x−sj (sj ) s où xi j désigne le système de solutions associé à la racine caractéristique sj .[Brechenmacher, 2007b]. 19 La pratique algébrique associée à l’équation séculaire ne se réduit cepen- dant pas à l’usage de tels procédés polynomiaux. En eﬀet, l’expression (*) est rarement utilisée en tant que telle mais le plus souvent incorporée au sein de dif- férentes méthodes élaborés dans divers cadres théoriques. Ainsi, dans l’approche de Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1766) sur les systèmes diﬀérentiels, cette pratique supporte la transformation d’un système de n équations diﬀérentielles linéaires à coeﬃcients constants à la forme intégrable de n équations indépendantes (un système diagonal en termes actuels). Elle est indissociable d’une représentation mécanique selon laquelle des oscillations d’un ﬁl lesté de n masses peuvent se représenter par la composition des oscillations propres de n ﬁls lestés d’une seule masse. La nature des racines de l’équation caractéristique a ainsi été liée à la condition de stabilité mécanique des oscillations. Cette pratique a par la suite sous-tendu une mathématisation des oscillations séculaires des planètes sur leurs orbites. Pour cette raison, l’équation sur laquelle elle est basée (l’équation caractéristique) a été dénommée \"l’équation à laquelle on détermine les inégalités séculaires des planètes\". Dans ce contexte, Pierre-Simon Laplace a cherché à démontrer la stabilité du système solaire en déduisant la nature réelle des racines de l’équation séculaire de la propriété de symétrie des systèmes mécaniques. Plus tard, Cauchy s’est appuyé en 1829 sur l’analogie entre les propriétés de cette équation et celles des équations caractéristiques des coniques et quadriques pour donner aux procédés élaborés par Lagrange une interprétation géométrique. La transformation de systèmes linéaires a alors été envisagée en terme de changements d’axes en géométrie analytique. Plus tard encore, ces mêmes procédés ont été associés aux calculs de résidus de l’analyse complexe, aux suites de Sturm d’une équation algébrique, aux classes d’équivalence des couples de formes quadratiques etc. Ces divers travaux reconnaissaient cependant une nature algébrique sous- jacente aux diﬀérents cadres théoriques mobilisées. Cette identité algébrique tient principalement à trois caractères. – Le premier est la permanence sur plus d’un siècle des procédés opératoires (*). – Le deuxième est l’ambition explicite de généralité qui se manifeste depuis la prise en compte par Lagrange de systèmes linéaires à n variables. – Le troisième est le caractère spécial de l’équation séculaire dont on a long- temps pensé que les racines devaient être non seulement réelles mais aussi distinctes.\" (Autour de pratiques algébriques de Poincaré : héritages de la réduction de Jordan)",

Dans ce cas, l’expression (*) est en eﬀet susceptible de 0 prendre une valeur 0 . Cette diﬃculté a suscité des critiques quant à la tendance de l’algèbre à attribuer une généralité excessive aux expressions symboliques. C’est d’ailleurs à partir de ce constat que Cauchy s’est détourné de l’algèbre au proﬁt de l’analyse complexe : le calcul des résidus permet en eﬀet de remplacer le problème de la multiplicité des racines par celui de la détermination des degrés des pôles de l’expression (*) envisagée comme une fonction méromorphe. À partir des années 1850, plusieurs approches algébriques du problème de la multiplicité des racines ont été développées de manière distinctes : matrices de Sylvester en géométrie analytique, réduites d’Hermite en théorie des formes quadratiques, diviseurs élémentaires de Weierstrass pour les couples de formes quadratiques et bilinéaires, réduction canonique de Jordan pour les systèmes diﬀérentiels linéaires à coeﬃcients constants.

Among this class is the celebrated hypergeometric equa- tion, z(z−1)d2w/dz2 +(c−(a+b+1)z) dw/dz − abw = 0 and we may confine our attention to it, al- though by then Fuchs had moved on to study other problems. Poincare ́ took from the later work of Fuchs the idea that the quotient of a basis of solu-tions to equation (1) was an interesting ob-ject. If the solutions are denoted w1(z) andw2(z), and the quotient as ζ(z) = w1(z) , then w2(z) analytic continuation of the solutions around a path enclosing a singular point returns the quotient in the form ζ(z) = (a11w1(z) + a12w2(z)) / (a21w1(z) + a22w2(z)) = (a11ζ(z)+a12) / (a21ζ(z) + a22) where the coefficients ajk are constants that depend on the path. As this formula makes clear, the ‘function’ ζ is a multi-valued func- tion, but its set-theoretic inverse is a general- isation of a periodic function: z(ζ) = z(a11 ζ + a12) / (a21ζ + a22) Geometrically, the function ζ(z) maps the up- per half-plane to a triangle, the vertices of which are the images of the singular points 0, 1, ∞ on the real axis, and the angles of which are determined by the coefficients a, b, c of the hypergeometric equation. An- alytic continuation shows that the lower half- plane is mapped to another triangle (which will be congruent if the coefficients are all real) and thereafter the images of the half-planes form a net of triangles, provided the angles are of the form π/n for some integers n.Moreover,eachtrianglewillhavethesame three angles, although their sides will be cir- cular arcs and not straight, and Poincare ́ in- troduced a simple geometric transformation to straighten them out. This much, but lit- tle more, formed the content of the essay Poincare ́ submitted for the prize in May 1880. The extra concerned a discussion of the net of triangles and made some corrections to Fuchs’s papers. He showed, for example, that if the angles of the triangles are π , π and π , 236 then the net covers the plane, eight suitably chosen triangles form a parallelogram, and z = z(ζ) is an elliptic function; but if the an- glesareπ andπ attheimageofz=0and 42 z = 1 respectively and π at ∞, then the net 6 lies inside a certain circle, and the sides of the triangles are circular arcs meeting this circle at right angles.\" (Poincare ́ and the idea of a group, Gray)",

He began by rais- ing the fundamental question of how we con- struct a sense of space around us at all. This was much discussed by psychologists at the time, and Poincare ́ observed that we can con- struct many spaces. A single motionless eye would construct a two-dimensional projective geometry with no sense of distance. A pair of eyes could construct a sense of depth. We have our sense of touch, and we could con- struct a high-dimensional space by recording the muscular sensations needed to put the tip of a finger somewhere. Out of this welter of experiences and before we are capable of formal instruction, we all construct a sense of three-dimensional space occupied by some bodies with predictable behaviour. These are the rigid bodies, and they are singled out by the fact that we can compensate for the mo- tion of a rigid body by a motion of our own. We can, for example, distinguish the motion of a glass from the motion of the wine swirling aroundinit.So,heargued,webuildupinour minds a sense of what rigid bodies are, and are able to handle them hypothetically. This mental construction gives us our idea of the isometries of a hypothetical rigid body, and from this we construct our concept of space – notice that rigid bodies and their motions came first in this analysis. The concept of dis- tance is derived from the behaviour of rigid bodies, which is why on this account Poincare ́ could dispute Russell’s claim about London, Paris, and the millimetre. For Poincare ́ the claim is true not because we know what dis- tance in space is, but because we know what isometries are. This knowledge is innate, it has evolved with the human species, and it is triggered by the experiences of every sentient infant.For Poincare ́ it is only via the introduction of the group that the non-measurable ‘space’ of Helmholtz and Lie becomes a measurable magnitude “that is to say, a veritable space”. Therefore [29, Sections 21 and 22]:“What we call a geometry is nothing but the formal properties of a certain continuous group . . . so that we may say, space is a group. But the assertion is no less true of the notion of many other continuous groups; for exam- ple, that which corresponds to the geometry of Lobachevskii. There are, accordingly, sev- eral geometries possible, and it remains to be seen how a choice is made between them.”Poincare ́ was adamant that different crea- tures, with a different history, might be non- Euclidean in the sense that their brains would find non-Euclidean geometry convenient. If we met such creatures, we would not share their sense of what is easy of natural, nor would they share ours, but neither side would be able to trap the other in a contradiction. Where we and they would differ would be in our innate understandings of rigid bodies, and we would be the ones whose brains ap- preciated that the translations in the group of isometries formed a normal subgroup, a statement that is false in the group of non- Euclidean isometries.This is fundamental epistemology (and quite different from his other convention- alisms). It accounts for the one wry observa- tion Poincare ́ had on Hilbert’s foundations of geometry as they were set out in his Grundla- gen der Geometrie [12], in 1899. Hilbert gave a purely axiomatic formulation, with no pre- tence to being an account of how we can have knowledge of the external world, and when Poincare ́ reviewed them he commented [33, p. 272] that:“The objects which he calls points, straight lines,orplanesbecomethuspurelylogical entities which it is impossible to represent to ourselves. We should not know how to pic- ture them as sensory images . . . Each of his geometries is still the study of a group. The logical point of view alone appears to interest him. With the foundation of the first propo- sition, with its psychological origin, he does not concern himself. His work is then incom- plete; but this is not a criticism . . . Incomplete one must indeed resign one’s self to be.”\" (Poincare ́ and the idea of a group, Gray)",

In both his pure mathematics and his work on mathematical physics he advocated the study of what he called form over matter, by which he meant the abstract system of rela- tions rather than specific objects that obey those relations. He looked for analogies that would enable a system of relations to be moved, with a degree of fidelity, from one field to another. In all of these ways the group idea was vital to him. In number theory it enabled him to place the modular equation in a rich- er setting, one that opened the way for some types of Fuchsian functions to do arithmetic work. The group idea was crucial to his anal- ysis of surfaces at the start of his career, and his work on 3-manifolds towards the end. It allowed him to classify domains of holomor- phic functions in C2. It allowed him to give an account of how we construct space around us, and also of the space and time of contem- porary physics (but not space-time, a step he refused to take). But in none of these areas did he then pause to study the groups in any detail. It was the idea of a group, not group theory, that animated him.\" (Poincare ́ and the idea of a group, Gray)",

In the early 1850's, Eisenstein's contemporary, Charles Hermite, who was in contact with Eisenstein, continued the latter's use of the symbolical algebra of linear sub- stitutions, both in his work on the theory of forms and on the transformation of abelian functions.

Weierstrass himself provides a good counterexample to this generality, for all his work on the spectral theory of forms was motivated by a concern for rigor, a concern that was vital to his accomplishments.Weierstrass was dissatisfied with the kind of algebraic proofs that were com- monplace in his time. These proofs proceeded by formal manipulation of the symbols involved, and no attention was given to the singular cases that could arise when the symbols were given actual values. One operated with symbols that were regarded as having \"general\" values, and hence such proofs were sometimes re- ferred to as treating the \"general case\", although it would be more appropriate to speak of the generic case. Generic reasoning had led Lagrange and Laplace to the incorrect conclusion that, in their problems, stability of the solutions to the system of linear differential equations required not only reality but the nonexistence of multiple roots. (Hence their problem had seemed all the more formidable !) In fact, Sturm who was the first to study the eigenvalue problem (1) proved among other things the \"theorem\" that the eigenvalues are not only real but distinct as well. His proof was of course generic, and he himself appears to have been uneasy about it; for at the end of his paper he confessed that some of his theorems might be subject to exceptions if the matrix coefficients are given specific values. Cauchy was much more careful to avoid what he called disparagingly \"the generalities of algebra,\" but multiple roots also proved problematic for him. As he realized, his proof of the existence of an orthogonal substitution which diagonalizes the given quadratic form depended upon the nonexistence of multiple roots. He tried to brush away the cases not covered by his proof with a vague reference to an infinitesimal argument that was anything but satisfactory.It was to clear up the muddle surrounding multiple roots by replacing generic arguments with truly general ones that Weierstrass was led to create his theory of elementary divisors. Here is a good example in which a concern for rigor proved productive rather than sterile. Another good example is to be found in the work of Frobenius, Weierstrass' student, as I shall shortly indicate.\"(The Theory of Matrices in the 19th Century, Hawkins)\" (The Theory of Matrices in the 19th Century, Hawkins)",

Euler called it p or c, until π became generally accepted - not least supported by Euler's adaption of Jones' π in his Introductio in Analaysin Infinitorum. But is this idea, named π, a number? Does the ratio of circumference and diameter exist in reality or in the brains of mathematicians? Surely not. In reality an ideal circle cannot exist because any real circle requires more mass than can be tolerated by an Euclidean space. On the other hand nobody will be able to imagine it. Not even the sharpest mind will be able to determine π better than up to two digits by pure imagination, few will be able to compute more than 5 digits of π in their mind using any desired algorithm, and even fewer will be able to memorize more than the first 50 digits (although it has been shown possible by Hideaki Tomoyori to know by heart 40000 digits) of π.Cauchy, Weierstrass, Cantor, and Dedekind attempted to give meaning to irrational numbers, well aware that there was more to do than to find suitable names.

Letztere wird jedoch in meiner Weise etwa durch (1.7, 1.73, 1.732, ...) befriedigend gegeben\" [2].It is argued that ◊3 does exist, because it can be approximated to any desired precision by some sequence (an) such that for any positive ε we can find a natural number n0 such that Ian - ◊3I < ε for n ¥ n0. It is clear that Cantor and his contemporaries could not perceive the principle limits of their approach. But every present-day scientist should know that it is in principle impossible to approximate any irrational like ◊3 by ε < 1/210100. (An exception are irrationals like ◊3/210100.

      "text": "\"Modern mathematics as religionModern mathematics doesn’t make complete sense. The unfortunate conse- quences include difficulty in deciding what to teach and how to teach it, many papers that are logically flawed, the challenge of recruiting young people to the subject, and an unfortunate teetering on the brink of irrelevance.If mathematics made complete sense it would be a lot easier to teach, and a lot easier to learn. Using flawed and ambiguous concepts, hiding confusions and circular reasoning, pulling theorems out of thin air to be justified ‘later’ (i.e. never) and relying on appeals to authority don’t help young people, they make things more difficult for them.If mathematics made complete sense there would be higher standards of rigour, with fewer but better books and papers published. That might make it easier for ordinary researchers to be confident of a small but meaningful contribution. If mathematics made complete sense then the physicists wouldn’t have to thrash around quite so wildly for the right mathematical theories for quantum field theory and string theory. Mathematics that makes complete sense tends to parallel the real world and be highly relevant to it, while mathematics that doesn’t make complete sense rarely ever hits the nail right on the head, although it can still be very useful.So where exactly are the logical problems? The troubles stem from the consistent refusal by the Academy to get serious about the foundational aspects of the subject, and are augmented by the twentieth centuries’ whole hearted and largely uncritical embrace of Set Theory.Most of the problems with the foundational aspects arise from mathemati- cians’ erroneous belief that they properly understand the content of public school and high school mathematics, and that further clarification and codification is largely unnecessary. Most (but not all) of the difficulties of Set Theory arise from the insistence that there exist ‘infinite sets’, and that it is the job of math- ematics to study them and use them.In perpetuating these notions, modern mathematics takes on many of the aspects of a religion. It has its essential creed–namely Set Theory, and its unquestioned assumptions, namely that mathematics is based on ‘Axioms’, in particular the Zermelo-Fraenkel ‘Axioms of Set Theory’. It has its anointed priesthood, the logicians, who specialize in studying the foundations of mathe- matics, a supposedly deep and difficult subject that requires years of devotion to master. Other mathematicians learn to invoke the official mantras when questioned by outsiders, but have only a hazy view about how the elementary aspects of the subject hang together logically.Training of the young is like that in secret societies–immersion in the cult involves intensive undergraduate memorization of the standard thoughts before they are properly understood, so that comprehension often follows belief instead of the other (more healthy) way around. A long and often painful graduate school apprenticeship keeps the cadet busy jumping through the many required hoops, discourages critical thought about the foundations of the subject, but then gradually yields to the gentle acceptance and support of the brotherhood. The ever-present demons of inadequacy, failure and banishment are however never far from view, ensuring that most stay on the well-trodden path.The large international conferences let the fellowship gather together and congratulate themselves on the uniformity and sanity of their world view, though to the rare outsider that sneaks into such events the proceedings no doubt seem characterized by jargon, mutual incomprehensibility and irrelevance to the outside world. The official doctrine is that all views and opinions are valued if they contain truth, and that ultimately only elegance and utility decide what gets studied. The reality is less ennobling–the usual hierarchical structures reward allegiance, conformity and technical mastery of the doctrines, elevate the interests of the powerful, and discourage dissent.There is no evil intent or ugly conspiracy here–the practice is held in place by a mixture of well-meaning effort, inertia and self-interest. We humans have a fondness for believing what those around us do, and a willingness to mold our intellectual constructs to support those hypotheses which justify our habits and make us feel good.\" (Set Theory, Should you Believe?, Wildberger)",

      "text": "\"The problem with foundationsThe reason that mathematics doesn’t make complete sense is quite easy to explain when we look at it from the educational side. Mathematicians, like everyone else, begin learning mathematics before kindergarten, with counting and basic shapes. Throughout the public and high school years (K-12) they are exposed to a mishmash of subjects and approaches, which in the better schools or with the better teachers involves learning about numbers, fractions, arith- metic, points, lines, triangles, circles, decimals, percentages, congruences, sets, functions, algebra, polynomials, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, trigonometry, rates of change, probabilities, logarithms, exponentials, quadrilaterals, areas, volumes, vectors and perhaps some calculus. The treatment is non-rigorous, inconsistent and even sloppy. The aim is to get the average student through the material with a few procedures under their belts, not to provide a proper logical framework for those who might have an interest in a scientific or mathematical career.In the first year of university the student encounters calculus more seri- ously and some linear algebra, perhaps with some discrete mathematics thrown in. Sometime in their second or third year, a dramatic change happens in the training of aspiring pure mathematicians. They start being introduced to the idea of rigorous thinking and proofs, and gradually become aware that they are not at the peak of intellectual achievement, but just at the foothills of a very onerous climb. Group theory, differential equations, fields, rings, topo- logical spaces, measure theory, operators, complex analysis, special functions, manifolds, Hilbert spaces, posets and lattices–it all piles up quickly. They learn to think about mathematics less as a jumble of facts to be memorized and algorithms to be mastered, but as a coherent logical structure. Assignment problems increasingly require serious thinking, and soon all but the very best are brain-tired and confused.Do you suppose the curriculum at this point has time or inclination to return to the material they learnt in public school and high school, and finally organize it properly? When we start to get really picky about logical correctness, doesn’t it make sense to go back and ensure that all those subjects that up to now have only been taught in a loose and cavalier fashion get a proper rigorous treatment? Isn’t this the appropriate time to finally learn what a number in fact is, why exactly the laws of arithmetic hold, what the correct definitions of a line and a circle are, what we mean by a vector, a function, an area and all the rest? You might think so, but there are two very good reasons why this is nowhere done.The first reason is that even the professors mostly don’t know! They too have gone through a similar indoctrination, and never had to prove that multi- plication is associative, for example, or learnt what is the right order of topics in trigonometry. Of course they know how to solve all the problems in elemen- tary school texts, but this is quite different from being able to correct all the logical defects contained there, and give a complete and proper exposition of the material.The modern mathematician walks around with her head full of the tight 3logical relationships of the specialized theories she researches, with only a rudi- mentary understanding of the logical foundations underpinning the entire sub- ject. But the worst part is, she is largely unaware of this inadequacy in her training. She and her colleagues really do believe they profoundly understand elementary mathematics. But a few well-chosen questions reveal that this is not so. Ask them just what a fraction is, or how to properly define an angle, or whether a polynomial is really a function or not, and see what kind of non- uniform rambling emerges! The more elementary the question, the more likely the answer involves a lot of philosophizing and bluster. The issue of the correct approach to the definition of a fraction is a particularly crucial one to public school education.Mathematicians like to reassure themselves that foundational questions are resolved by some mumbo-jumbo about ‘Axioms’ (more on that later) but in reality successful mathematics requires familiarity with a large collection of ‘el- ementary’ concepts and underlying linguistic and notational conventions. These are often unwritten, but are part of the training of young people in the sub- ject. For example, an entire essay could be written on the use, implicit and explicit, of ordering and brackets in mathematical statements and equations. Codifying this kind of implicit syntax is a job professional mathematicians are not particularly interested in.The second reason is that any attempt to lay out elementary mathematics properly would be resisted by both students and educators as not going forward, but backwards. Who wants to spend time worrying about the correct approach to polynomials when Measure theory and the Residue calculus beckon instead? The consequence is that a large amount of elementary mathematics is never properly taught anywhere.But there are two foundational topics that are introduced in the early under- graduate years: infinite set theory and real numbers. Historically these are very controversial topics, fraught with logical difficulties which embroiled mathemati- cians for decades. The presentation these days is matter of fact–‘an infinite set is a collection of mathematical objects which isn’t finite’ and ‘a real number is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers’.Or some such nonsense. Set theory as presented to young people simply doesn’t make sense, and the resultant approach to real numbers is in fact a joke! You heard it correctly–and I will try to explain shortly. The point here is that these logically dubious topics are slipped into the curriculum in an off-hand way when students are already overworked and awed by all the other material before them. There is not the time to ruminate and discuss the uncertainties of generations gone by. With a slick enough presentation, the whole thing goes down just like any other of the subjects they are struggling to learn. From then on till their retirement years, mathematicians have a busy schedule ahead of them, ensuring that few get around to critically examining the subject matter of their student days.\" (Set Theory, Should you Believe?, Wildberger)",

Anyone who has ever watched a goods train beginning to move will have noticed how the impulse is communicated with a jerk from each truck to the next, until as last even the hindmost truck is in motion. When the train is very long, it is a very long time before the last truck moves. If the train were infinitely long, there would be an infinite succession of jerks, and the time would never come when the whole train would be in motion. Nevertheless, if there were a series of trucks no longer than the series of inductive numbers..., every truck would begin to move sooner or later if the engine persevered, though there would always be other trucks further back which had not yet begun to move.\"This is a quote from B. Ru;ssell's Introduction to mathematical philosophy, pages 27-28, that I think describes well this limitation of induction:There are contexts in which a statement P(n) can be proved for all n∈ℕ by induction, and has a counterpart P(∞) that is false. In other contexts, P(∞) may be true. But even then, induction on ℕ does not prove the P(∞) case.Getting back to limits of functions, note for example that: A finite sum of continuous functions is continuous. A pointwise convergent series of continuous functions need not be continuous. But, a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions is continuous.So in this case, going from finite sums to infinite series requires new tools, different types of convergence, to obtain the desired properties. As for real analytic functions, I don't know what can be said along these lines. For complex analytic functions there are nicer results, such as the fact that a locally uniformly convergent sequence of complex analytic functions is complex analytic. In the real case, to give a stark contrast, every continuous function on a bounded interval is a uniform limit of polynomials (as analytic as you can get), but there are continuous functions that are differentiable nowhere. Similarly, a continuously differentiable function of period 2π is the uniform limit of its Fourier series, but continuously differentiable functions need not even be twice differentiable, let alone analytic.\" (Russel)",

The more familiar direction is constructive, towards gradually increas- ing complexity: from integers to fractions, real numbers, complex numbers; from addition and multiplication to differentiation and integration, and on to higher mathematics. The other direction, whichis less familiar, proceeds, by analysing, to greater and greater abstract- ness and logical simplicity; instead of asking what can be defined and deduced from what is assumed to begin with, we ask instead what more general ideas and principles can be found, in terms of which what was our starting-point can be defined or deduced. It is the fact of pursuing this opposite direction that characterises mathemat- ical philosophy as opposed to ordinary mathematics. But it should be understood that the distinction is one, not in the subject matter, but in the state of mind of the investigator. Early Greek geometers, passing from the empirical rules of Egyptian land-surveying to the general propositions by which those rules were found to be justifiable, and thence to Euclid’s axioms and postulates, were engaged in math- ematical philosophy, according to the above definition; but when once the axioms and postulates had been reached, their deductive employment, as we find it in Euclid, belonged to mathematics in the ordinary sense.

      "text": "\"The notion of order is one which has enormous importance in mathematics. Not only the integers, but also rational fractions and all real numbers have an order of magnitude, and this is essential to most of their mathematical properties. The order of points on a line is essential to geometry; so is the slightly more complicated order of lines through a point in a plane, or of planes through a line. Dimensions, in geometry, are a development of order. The conception of a limit, which underlies all higher mathematics, is a serial conception. There are parts of mathematics which do not depend upon the notion of order, but they are very few in comparison with the parts in which this notion is involved.In seeking a definition of order, the first thing to realise is that no set of terms has just one order to the exclusion of others. A set of terms has all the orders of which it is capable. Sometimes one orderis so much more familiar and natural to our | thoughts that we are inclined to regard it as the order of that set of terms; but this is a mistake. The natural numbers—or the “inductive” numbers, as we shall also call them—occur to us most readily in order of magnitude; but they are capable of an infinite number of other arrangements. We might, for example, consider first all the odd numbers and then all the even numbers; or first 1, then all the even numbers, then all the odd multiples of 3, then all the multiples of 5 but not of 2 or 3, then all the multiples of 7 but not of 2 or 3 or 5, and so on through the whole series of primes. When we say that we “arrange” the numbers in these various orders, that is an inaccurate expression: what we really do is to turn our attention to certain relations between the natural numbers, which themselves generate such-and-such an arrangement. We can no more “arrange” the natural numbers than we can the starry heavens; but just as we may notice among the fixed stars either their order of brightness or their distribution in the sky, so there are various relations among numbers which may be observed, and which give rise to various different orders among numbers, all equally legitimate. And what is true of numbers is equally true of points on a line or of the moments of time: one order is more familiar, but others are equally valid. We might, for example, take first, on a line, all the points that have integral co-ordinates, then all those that have non-integral rational co-ordinates, then all those that have algebraic non-rational co-ordinates, and so on, through any set of complications we please. The resulting order will be one which the points of the line certainly have, whether we choose to notice it or not; the only thing that is arbitrary about the various orders of a set of terms is our attention, for the terms themselves have always all the orders of which they are capable.\" (Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy by Bertrand Russell)",

Why did this major Western thinker find this simple thing so hard to understand?First, Descartes took it for granted that the straight line was the natural figure, and that curved lines must necessarily be understood in terms of straight lines, and not the other way around. Second, he ruled out empirical procedures as not mathematics.

(The other thing he claims credit for is the sine series, which was obviously known from earlier, though not in Europe.) And, historians, today, once again credit Newton with the calculus on the grounds that he had rigorously proved the “fundamental theorem of calculus”.Of course, Newton was mistaken in thinking that this “fluency” of time provided a solution to the problem of supertasks. Many discerning people were aware of this, and Berkeley took it upon himself to tear Newton’s theory of fluxions to bits, when there seemed a danger that Newton’s views on the church would become public. In the event, Newton’s History of the Church in 8 volumes, a result of 50 years of scholarship, was successfully suppressed, and Berkeley’s criticism was subsequently played down.Regardless of its probable motivation, and regardless of the subsequent attempts to play it down, Berkeley’s criticism was valid. His argument was very simple and robust, and interesting. He assumes, along with Newton, Descartes, and Galileo, that mathematics is perfect, and cannot neglect even the smallest quantity. However, he goes along with Newton and allows that a quantity may be neglected if it is infinitesimal (whatever that might mean). But, he asks, if a quantity is to be set to zero at the end of the calculation, why not set it to zero in the beginning itself?We know the modern answer to Berkeley’s objections: that the ratio of two infinitesimals may be finite. A hundred years ago, when neither Non-Standard analysis nor non- Archimedean fields had come in, and infinitesimals were still formally disreputable, the idea was to try and define limits by playing on the space provided by the non-definition of 0/0. Dedekind’s formal real numbers, or the continuum, by allowing infinite divisibility, seemed to be just the right framework for such limits. That is how advanced calculus (or elementary analysis) is still taught—by appealing to the completeness of the (formal) real numbers. But, of course, it was evident, even in Dedekind’s time, that the construction of formal real numbers required set theory which was suspect for the infinitary processes it involved.The axiomatisation of set theory has tamed those doubts in an interesting way. From curves, to numbers, the doubts have now been pushed into the domain of set theory which the average mathematician does not care about. So, like the professional theologians who were concerned with establishing the number of angels that could fit on the head of a pin, without bothering about fundamental questions as to the nature of God, the professional mathematician can merrily go on proving theorems without bothering about the supertasks used in set theory.Secondly, on the philosophy of formalism the only question that mathematicians will accept about the process is that of consistency. The consistency of set theory has not been formally proved, of course, but mathematicians believe it is consistent. It is interesting to see the double standards involved here.Thus, if supertasks were really regarded as really admissible, one should be able to apply them also in metamathematics. In that case, it would be a trivial matter to use some transfinite induction principle, such as Zorn’s lemma, or Hausdorff maximality principle, to make set theory decidable. In such a case, the theory obviously cannot be consistent, by Godel’s theorem, for it easily accommodates a statement which asserts its own negation. Thus, the consistency of set theory is maintained by means of a double standard: allow supertasks within mathematics, but not while talking about mathematics. It is interesting to note the theological parallel: it was exactly such a double standard that was needed to claim the consistency of the notion of an omnipotent, and omniscient God with the existence of evil in the world!\" (Zeroism and calculus without limits, C.K Raju)",

The partial sums of the series clearly oscillate between the values of 0 and 1 and hence the series is judged to be divergent on conventional analysis. However, in many practical situations it is convenient to define thesum of this series as 1 . Such a definition may seem puzzling at first sight since the 2series never attains that value, and the sum to any finite number of terms is always either 0 or 1. This is an example of an “asymptotically convergent” series. The point is that just like 0/0, the sum of an infinite number of terms has no arithmetical meaning of its own. Within the philosophy of formal mathematics, such a meaning has to be assigned by definition: and definitions, as everyone knows are bound to have some arbitrariness in them. The above definition is practically convenient and is often used in physics in the more sophisticated form .=1, where  is the Heaviside function and  is 2the Dirac delta function. So we are back to the situation where there is no need to actually perform any supertasks. When a seeming supertask arises, what one needs, instead, is a process (a finite process) which needs to be carried out.

They monopolized editorial boards of `prestigious'(i.e. snooty, e.g. Acta, Annals, Invent.) journals and would-be-prestigious journals (which are even more pathetic, e.g. Duke J. and Israel J.), as well as the Fields Medal committee. Most people have heard Whitehead's epithet that `Graph Theory is the slum of topology', and many have agreed.I am pleased to be alive to witness the beginning of the trivialization of Topology. First came the Jones polynomials, that historically arose in another `fancy field': C* algebras, but this turned out to be a red herring, and thanks to the work of Lou Kauffman and others, they could have, and should have, arisen directly in elementary graph theory, being a very special case of the Tutte (chromatic) polynomials.Now, even more dramatically, we have the Seiberg-Witten invariants. It was Nati Seiberg who made the initial breakthrough, in the context of `exactly-solvable-models' in quantum field theory. Ed Witten, who speaks fluently both the language of topology and that of physics, realized the revolutionary significance.Myself, I don't know either languages. Nevertheless, I am almost sure that, just like the Jones polynomials, the Seiberg-Witten invariant would be reducible to combinatorics and/or high-school algebra. Similar developments will occur all over mathematics, and will make many heavy tomes written by arrogant `high-brow' mathematicians, all obsolete, and unnecessary.In this process, computer algebra, that great implementer of high-school algebra, will play a central role.The king (abstract math) is dead.

One of them is a problem in categorical algebra proposed to me by a professor. Yesterday, we talked about it for some time (about 2 hours), and we both got fairly tired of it (especially the lack of progress). Hence he asked me what else I've been working on. I mentioned that I'm giving a talk this week at our discrete mathematics colloquium, about Sturmian words and Beatty sequences (my small contribution to a problem of O'Bryant). I proceeded to describe the jist of what I had done, and he looked dismayed.He then said \"There should be a nice diagramatic way to do this,\" and showed that he didn't really understand what was going on at all. When I tried to explain where he went wrong, he got visably upset, and then said \"well, I don't know how, but perhaps you should find it [the nice method].\" I told him that I didn't think it fruitful to try and look for a way to visualize the problem in terms of commutative diagrams.He told me that diagrams force you to look at concepts, and not special cases (derisively implying that that was what I had been looking at). The conversation went on in this vein, and moved to number theory. He said \"I think number theorists don't look at numbers correctly; they are equivalence classes of sets. When you look at them on too small a level, you get lost in special cases and coincidences. They don't really know what they're looking at.\" This shocked and surprised me (as I once intended to be a number theorist, and still hold an intense interest in it). I changed the subject. I still want to work with my professor despite his bigotry.I really don't understand this. He treated combinatorics and number theory as nothing more than a collection of meaningless special cases and coincidences. I've looked at your website in the past, and always assumed that the discrimination of the mathematical upper class (topologists, etc.) was something which you had exaggerated out of all control. Now I see that it is real, but I can't begin to fathom it. This sort of attitude seems to me to defeat the purpose of mathematics. A problem should be worked on iff it is interesting. I do find algebraic geometry considerably more interesting than graph theory. Yet this is only a matter of personal taste, so it seems unrelated to the importance of the mathematical results. \"(http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion1.html)",

      "text": "\"Even while considering the universe to be finite, one can do mathematics symbolically as a game with a system of rules. If the game doesn't have enough pieces we just add new pieces, with new properties or allowed moves as required. All that matters is that the enlarged system is compatible with the old system; that the smaller game is a subgame of the large one; that the smaller system can be embedded in the larger one.When does something exist ? Well if there isn't something from amongst the objects under consideration that has the properties we want then we just create new symbols and define how they relate to the old ones.If we were a pythagorean and the only numbers that exist are rational numbers, then we wouldn't call 2√ a number, but if we were also finitist symbolicists then we could embed any collection of numbers into a collection that contains not only numbers but also \"splodges\" which is what we're going to call 2√. It's important to always keep in mind that 2√ isn't a number - it's a splodge. In this new system of arithmetic we've invented we can add numbers to splodges to get new splodges like 1+2√. What a fun game. Let's add some more splodges. We're bored with algebraic splodges so let's add some non-algebraic splodges like the one in your question. Of course that expression is a bit cumbersome so we'll give it the shorthand symbol π instead.Given a splodge x, it would make calculus easier if there were a splodge x+o that was nearer to x than any other splodge, however that isn't possible so we embed the splodges in a larger system called the hypersplodges that contains not only splodges but also vapors, and contains not only the concept nearer but also the concept \"nearer\". Vapors like x+o are \"nearer\" to x than any splodge could ever be, and when you're finished using them they evaporate leaving just a splodge.We want a splodge that satisfies x2+1=0 however there isn't one, so we embed the splodges in a larger system called weirdums in which we've added a piece called i with the rule that i2=−1, and under the new system we can \"add\" splodges to weirdums to get new weirdums like 1+i.In solving differential equations we'd like a function which is zero everywhere except at a single point but which has a non-zero area under the curve. There is no function that behaves like this so we'll go to a larger system that contains not only functions but also spikes which do have the desired property because the larger system contains a rule about spikes which says they do. Conveniently certain calculations involving spikes cancel out leaving just functions.A finitist or ultrafinitist shouldn't recognise the concept of infinite sets therefore the only sets are finite-sets and since all sets are finite the adjective finite is superfluous therefore from this point onwards we just use the term \"set\". Some people want to consider sets that contain things they haven't put in there themselves - which of course can't be done because a set only contains the items we've put there. So we embed the system of sets in a larger system that includes not only sets but also dafties. In this daft system the rules are that a daftie can have an \"affinity\" for things whether those things have been previously mentioned or not. Dafties have an affinity for things in the same way that sets contain things. A compatible embedding of a system of sets in the daft system means that a set has an affinity for the items it contains when the set is considered as part of the daft system, therefore by daft reasoning one can say things not only about dafties but also about sets. To each set one can attach a number. You can't do this with dafties so we embed the numbers in a larger system containing sinners and attach a sinner to each daftie. Sometimes there is a need for something that looks like a daftie but has no sinner - such things are called messes. A mess can have an affinity for collections of dafties that no daftie could have an affinity for. This could go on, but you need gobbledegook theory. The set system has zero gobbledegook. The daft system is level-1 gobbledegook. The messy system is level-2 gobbledegook. Finitists like to maintain a zero level of gobbledegook. Analysts are usually happy with one-level of gobbledegook and category-theorists are comfortable with any amount of gobbledegook.There are two ways to compatibally extend a system:1) a conservative extension adds new items but doesn't say anything new about the old items that couldn't be said before;2) a progressive extension does say new things about the old items but only about things that were previously undecidableP.S. We can combine the vapors, splodges and linedups in a system called the messysplodges but they haven't been studied much because they're a bit messy.\" (http://mathoverflow.net/questions/102237/what-is-the-status-of-irrational-numbers-within-finitism-ultrafinitism by Steve L.

Consider this remark from Frege [15], and compare it to Arbib’s [1], above:A single [proof] step is often really a whole compendium, equivalent to several simple inferences, and into it there can still creep along with these some elements from intuition. In proofs as we know them, progress is by jumps, ... [and] the bigger the jump, the more diverse are the combinations it can represent of simple inferences with axioms derived from intuition ... [My] demand is not to be denied: every jump must be barred from our deductions.17 And consider this remark from Pasch in 1915:A statement R1 is a consequent of B only because its derivation from the latter is completely independent of the meanings of the geometrical concepts occurring in it, so that the proof can be carried through without support from an actual or imagined diagram or from any sort of ‘intuition’. A proof which does not meet this condition is no mathematical proof.18After quoting Pasch’s remark, Greaves ([17], p. 75) adds: ‘This definition of acceptable proof in geometry is still current today’. Is it really? Perhaps this turns on what we’re willing to describe as ‘geometry’. Consider Spivak [38], p. 30-31. Among the exercises for chapter 1, we read: ‘Consider the three surfaces shown below’. Below are three diagrams described as ‘(A) The infinite-holed torus’, ‘(B) The doubly infinite-holed torus’, and ‘(C) The infinite jail cell window’. We then read ‘(b) Surfaces (A) and (C) are homeomorphic! Hint: The region cut out by the lines in surface (C) is a cylinder, which occurs at the left of (A). Now draw in two more lines enclosing more holes, and consider the region between the two pairs’.19It’s clear that Frege and Pasch (and Hilbert, for that matter) were pressing for a significant practical change in the proof practices of ordinary mathematics. Traditional proofs in ordinary mathematics that contained large jumps based on intuitive considerations–such jumps indicated symptomatically, although hardly exclusively, by the presence of diagrams for guidance–were to be forever excised from respectable mathematical proof, and replaced by gapless derivations. This, as even an elementary inspection of current mathematics will make manifestly obvious, has not happened.20 Consequently this stronger demand of Frege, Pasch, and company, has been replaced by the (Steiner-Fallis) weaker constraint of ‘in principle’ translations. But this leaves unanswered the question of why the orig- inal program of changing the practice of mathematics failed. I want to suggest that it isn’t merely a matter of the fact that such derivations–in practice–are too long.21 Rather, my suggestion is that the ‘objects’ that mathematical reasoning is prima facie about are essential to the capacity of the mathematician to create and understand mathematical proofs.\" (Is there still a Sense in which Mathematics can have Foundations?

Consistency in math is a plausible goal, for a foundational system so often described as being “secure.” Bishop claims that consistency is ensured in constructive math, up to human error, making it a non-issue for the constructivist mathematician (Bishop (1967), 353). But he never justiﬁes any claim about the impossibility of deriving a contradiction through constructivist rules of inference. Without such a justiﬁcation, constructivism is in no better position than classical math, paradoxes or no paradoxes. Brouwer is more verbose than Bishop on this topic, but similarly casts the issue oﬀ as irrelevant. Hesseling says, “If we have a set of logical axioms, Brouwer argues, and we can point out amathematical system of which the logical axioms can be considered to express properties, we know that no contradiction can occur, because a constructed math-ematical system cannot contain a contradiction.” (Hesseling (2003), 42)Brouwer denies the necessity and validity of consistency proofs. He holds that such proofs only prove something about a formal linguistic system for communicating math, and that they don’t prove anything about the mathematical content the system sets out to represent. There is not a trade-oﬀ, per se, between constructivism and classical math, since the choice to adopt constructivism is mainly a matter of ontological belief and preference. The primary methodological advantage of constructivism is that it oﬀers us a rubric for deter-mining mathematical validity: namely, whether or not a construction has been performed.

In some ways, this reaction makes sense; what is math (at least, in practice) if not a product of human minds? The constructivists, also known as intuitionists, are the quintessential conservative group; they took extreme pains to pare math down to exactly what is accessible to the human mind. In the end, though, their tactics failed to sway any more than a handful of other mathematicians, and classical math proceeded forth undeterred, counter-intuitive results and all.

Mathematics needs little to get started and, once started, a little bit goes a long way.5. Basic conceptions differ in their degree of clarity. One may speak of what is true in a given conception, but that notion of truth may be partial. Truth in full is applicable only to completely clear conceptions.6. What is clear in a given conception is time dependent, both for the individual and historically.7. Pure (theoretical) mathematics is a body of thought developed systematically by successive refinement and reflective expansion of basic structural conceptions.8. The general ideas of order, succession, collection, relation, rule and operation are pre- mathematical; some implicit understanding of them is necessary to the understanding of mathematics.9. The general idea of property is pre-logical; some implicit understanding of that and of the logical particles is also a prerequisite to the understanding of mathematics. The reasoning of mathematics is in principle logical, but in practice relies to a considerable extent on various forms of intuition in order to arrive at understanding and conviction. 10. The objectivity of mathematics lies in its stability and coherence under repeated communication, critical scrutiny and expansion by many individuals often working independently of each other. Incoherent concepts, or ones which fail to withstand critical examination or lead to conflicting conclusions are eventually filtered out from mathematics. The objectivity of mathematics is a special case of intersubjective objectivity that is ubiquitous in social reality.\" (Conceptions of the Continuum, Feferman)",

On the other hand, the idea of a function from N into {0, 1} is based on a quite different intuition, namely as an arbitrary many-one correspondence considered extensionally, i.e. independently of how the correspondence may be effected, while rules are thought of intensionally, i.e. as specific procedures to carry out the requisite evaluations.

Here are some aspects not accounted for: linearity, composi- tion, continuity, and fullness. By linearity, we mean the quality Euclid had in mind when he wrote that a line is that which has length but not breadth. We can zoom in on a plane or even on a self-similar fractal set. By composition we mean the question whether the continuum is composed of (infinitely many) points, each of which has zero length, but whose aggregation can make intervals of nonzero length. The alternative conception is that somehow these points need to be actively created “at run time”, as a computer scientist might say; per- haps by Brouwer’s “free choices” or by some sort of quantum-mechanical device. The zooming processes also do not address the continuity of the continuum, the property that Dedekind addressed with his definition of completeness (every cut determines a real) and Cauchy with his definition of completeness (Cauchy se- quences converge). By specifying that there are no visible gaps, we rule out the possibility that we are zooming in on some kind of fractal set rather than the true continuum. But, there are also invisible gaps to worry about: while zooming, how can we tell whether we are seeing the whole continuum or only, say, the rational numbers? No matter how many times we zoom in on never becomes visible. We can call attention to it by placing a right isosceles triangle with its hypotenus on the number line. We can similarly call attention to any recursive real number; but how about the gap in the recursive reals at the limit of a Specker sequence? Can you visualize that gap? As the predicates used to define a Dedekind cut increase more and more in logical complexity, the existence of a point filling that cut seems less and less closely related to a fun- damental geometric intuition. Finally, the property of fullness of the continuum, as axiomatized in this paper using the fullness principle FP, seems similar to continuity, but distinct, since the recursive reals satisfy continuity (in the sense that recursively Cauchy sequences of recursive reals converge to recursive reals), but they do not satisfy FP. Fullness does not require reference to specific “gaps”, since it is defined by coverings. Perhaps the formulation of the fullness property and the recognition that it is not the same as continuity may help in future efforts to elicidate our intuitions about the continuum.\" (Constructivity, Computability, and the Continuum, Michael Beeson)",

Apparently he did not think that one can fill the gaps with computable numbers: he invented his theory of choice sequences. He said, for example, there is a real number 0.334434333444344..., where we are free to choose at any stage a 3 or a 4 ar- bitrarily, according to our free will. He did not require that we specify at any finite stage an algorithm for making all the rest of the choices.3 The necessity for functions defined on [0,1] to be defined on all choice sequences led to his continuity principle, that all such functions are continuous. This principle flatly contradicted classical mathematics, and was responsible in no small part for the well-known public relations problems of Brouwer’s intuitionistic mathematics.Hermann Weyl was also concerned with the problem of “filling the gaps”.\" (Constructivity, Computability, and the Continuum, Michael Beeson)",

Brouwer died in 1966, so he lived to see these results, but in his usual style, he never commented on them in print. They may have made him glad that he had developed the theory of choice sequences. Nevertheless, the Russian constructivists under the leader of Markov pursued the development of constructive mathematics assuming Church’s thesis for some decades. At the time of Brouwer’s death it appeared that your choices were:(1) accept Brouwer’s theories, give up most of mathematics and give up talking to most mathematicians; or(2) accept Church’s thesis, give up analysis and give up talking to most mathematicians; or(3) reject constructive mathematics entirely.This was not a difficult choice for most mathematicians; but Errett Bishop refused the prongs of this dilemma and published a book [2] in 1967 (the year after Brouwer’s death) in which he developed constructive mathematics without using either Church’s thesis or choice sequences. Since he didn’t assume every real is recursive, the recursive counterexamples do not apply directly. Since he didn’t assume there are some non-recursive reals (e.g. choice sequences), the classical theorems are not directly contradicted. His idea was to show that by suitable choices of definitions, the constructive content of classical mathematics could be brought to the fore, and was substantial.Logicians labored in the subsequent decade to analyze what Bishop had done, by constructing suitable formal theories and studying their formal inter- pretations. This work is summarized in [1]. These studies verified (for various formal theories) that Bishop’s work is indeed consistent with Church’s thesis as well as with classical mathematics, and is constructive in the sense that “when a person proves an integer to exist, he or she can produce that integer”. This is reflected in the “numerical existence property” of a formal theory T: if T proves ∃xA(x) then for some numeral n ̄, T proves A(n ̄).\" (Constructivity, Computability, and the Continuum, Michael Beeson)",

The Chinese were also able to solve simultaneous equations involving negative numbers.For a long time, negative solutions to problems were considered \"false\". In Hellenistic Egypt, the Greek mathematician Diophantus in the third century A.D. referred to an equation that was equivalent to 4x + 20 = 0 (which has a negative solution) in Arithmetica, saying that the equation was absurd.The use of negative numbers was known in early India, and their role in situations like mathematical problems of debt was understood.[10] Consistent and correct rules for working with these numbers were formulated.[11] The diffusion of this concept led the Arab intermediaries to pass it to Europe.[10]The ancient Indian Bakhshali Manuscript, which Pearce Ian claimed was written some time between 200 BC. and AD 300,[12] while George Gheverghese Joseph dates it to about AD 400 and no later than the early 7th century,[13] carried out calculations with negative numbers, using \"+\" as a negative sign.[14]During the 7th century AD, negative numbers were used in India to represent debts. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta (written in A.D. 628), discussed the use of negative numbers to produce the general form quadratic formula that remains in use today. He also found negative solutions of quadratic equations and gave rules regarding operations involving negative numbers and zero, such as \"A debt cut off from nothingness becomes a credit; a credit cut off from nothingness becomes a debt. \" He called positive numbers \"fortunes,\" zero \"a cipher,\" and negative numbers \"debts.\"[15][16]During the 8th century AD, the Islamic world learned about negative numbers from Arabic translations of Brahmagupta's works,[citation needed] and by the 10th century Islamic mathematicians were using negative numbers for debts. The earliest known Islamic text that uses negative numbers is A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen by Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī.[17]In the 12th century AD in India, Bhāskara II also gave negative roots for quadratic equations but rejected them because they were inappropriate in the context of the problem. He stated that a negative value is \"in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.\"Knowledge of negative numbers eventually reached Europe through Latin translations of Arabic and Indian works.European mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th century, although Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debits (chapter 13 of Liber Abaci, AD 1202) and later as losses (in Flos).In the 15th century, Nicolas Chuquet, a Frenchman, used negative numbers as exponents and referred to them as “absurd numbers.”[citation needed]In A.D. 1759, Francis Maseres, an English mathematician, wrote that negative numbers \"darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple\". He came to the conclusion that negative numbers were nonsensical.[18]In the 18th century it was common practice to ignore any negative results derived from equations, on the assumption that they were meaningless.[19]\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number)",

      "text": "\"At the end of December 1755, in a letter to Fagnano alluding to correspondence exchanged before the end of 1754, Lagrange speaks of Euler’s Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes, sive solution problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti, published at Lausanne and Geneva in 1744. The same letter shows that as early as the end of 1754 Lagrange had found interesting results in this area, which was to become the calculus of variations (a term coined by Euler in 1766).On 12 August 1755 Lagrange sent Euler a summary, written in Latin, of the purely analytical method that he used for this type of problem. It considered, he wrote in 1806, in varying the y’s in the integral formula in x and y, which should be a maximum or a minimum by ordinary differentiations, but relative to another characteristic δ, different form the ordinary characteristic d. It was further dependent on determining the differential value of the formula with respect to this new characteristic by transporting the sign δ after the signs d and ∫ when it is placed before. The differentials of δy under the ∫ signs are then eliminated through integration by parts.In a letter to d’Alembert of 2 November 1769 Lagrange confirmed that this method of maxima and minima was the first fruit of his studies—he was only nineteen when he devised it—and that he regarded it as his best work in mathematics.Euler replied to Langrange on 6 September 1755 that he was very interested in the technique. Lagrange’s merit was likewise recognized in Turin; and he was named, by a royal decree of 28 September 1755, professor at the Royal Artillery School with an annual salary of 250 crowns—a sum never increased in all the years he remained in his native country.In 1756, in a letter to Euler that has been lost, Lagrange applied the calculus of variations to mechanics. Euler had demonstrated, at the end of his Methodus, that the trajectory described by a material point subject to the influence of central forces is the same as that obtained by supposing that the integral of the velocity multiplied by the element of the curve is either a maximum or a minimum. Lagrange extended “this beautiful theorem” to an arbitrary system of bodies and derived from it a procedure for solving all the problems of dynamics.\" (Lagrange, Joseph Louis, Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography | 2008 | Copyright)",

      "text": "\"A ce compte, l'aptitude spéciale aux mathéma- tiques ne serait due qu'à une mémoire très sûre, ou bien à une force d'attention prodigieuse. Ce serait une qualité analogue à celle du joueur de whist, qui retient les cartes tombées; ou bien, pour nous élever d'un degré, à celle du joueur d'échecs qui peut envisager un nombre très grand de combinai- sons et les garder dans sa mémoire. Tout bon mathématicien devrait être en même temps bon joueur d'échecs et inversement; il devrait être éga- lement un bon calculateur numérique. Certes, cela arrive quelquefois, ainsi Gauss était à la fois un géomètre de génie et un calculateur très précoce et très sûr.Mais il y a des exceptions, ou plutôt je me trompe, je ne puis pas appeler cela des exceptions, sans quoi les exceptions seraient plus nombreuses que les cas conformes à la règle. C'est Gauss, au contraire, qui était une exception. Quant à moi, je suis obligé de l'avouer, je suis absolument inca- pable de faire une addition sans faute. Je serais également un fort mauvais joueur d'échecs; je cal- culerais bien qu'en jouant de telle façon je m'expose à tel danger; je passerais en revue beaucoup d'autres coups que je rejetterais pour d'autres raisons, et je finirais par jouer le coup d'abord examiné, ayant oublié dans l'intervalle le danger que j'avais prévu,En un mot ma mémoire n'est pas mauvaise, mais elle serait insuffisante pour faire de moi un bon joueur d'échecs. Pourquoi donc ne me fait-elle pas défaut dans un raisonnement mathématique diffi- cile où la plupart des joueurs d'échecs se per- draient? C'est évidemment parce qu'elle est guidée par la marche générale du raisonnement. Une démonstration mathématique n'est pas une simple juxtaposition de syllogismes, ce sont des syllo- gismes placés dans un certain ordre, et l'ordre dans lequel ces éléments sont placés est beaucoup plus important que ne le sont ces éléments eux-mêmes. Si j'ai le sentiment, l'intuition pour ainsi dire de cet ordre, de façon à apercevoir d'un coup d'oeil l'en- semble du raisonnement, je ne dois plus craindre d'oublier l'un des éléments, chacun d'eux viendra se placer de lui-même dans le cadre qui lui est pré- paré, et sans que j'aie à faire aucun effort de mémoire.Il me semble alors, en répétant un raisonnement appris, que j'aurais pu l'inventer; ce n'est souvent qu'une illusion; mais, même alors, même si je ne suis pas assez fort pour créer par moi-même, je le réinvente moi-même, à mesure que je le répète.On conçoit que ce sentiment, cette intuition de l'ordre mathématique, qui nous fait deviner des har- monies et des relations cachées, ne puisse appartenir à tout le monde. Les uns ne posséderont ni ce sentiment délicat, et difficile à définir, ni une force de mémoire et d'attention au-dessus de l'ordinaire, et alors ils seront absolument incapables de com- prendre les mathématiques un peu élevées; c'est le plus grand nombre. D'autres n'auront ce sentiment qu'à un faible degré, mais ils seront doués d'une mémoire peu commune et d'une grande capacité d'attention. Ils apprendront par cœur les détails les uns après les autres, ils pourront comprendre les mathématiques et quelquefois les appliquer, mais ils seront hors d'état de créer. Les autres enfin pos- séderont à un plus ou moins haut degré l'intuition spéciale dont je viens de parler et alors non seule- ment ils pourront comprendre les mathématiques, quand même leur mémoire n'aurait rien d'extraor- dinaire, mais ils pourront devenir créateurs et cher- cher à inventer avec plus ou moins de succès, sui- vant que cette intuition est chez eux plus ou moins développée.Qu'est-ce, en effet, que l'invention mathématique ? Elle ne consiste pas à faire de nouvelles combinai-sons avec des êtres mathématiques déjà connus.Cela, n'importe qui pourrait le faire, mais les com-binaisons que l'on pourrait former ainsi seraient en nombre infini, et le plus grand nombre serait abso-lument dépourvu d'intérêt. Inventer, cela consiste précisément à ne pas construire les combinaisons inutiles et à construire celles qui sont utiles et qui ne sont qu'une intime minorité. Inventer.c'estdis-ce de ???, de choisir.Comment doit se faire ce choix, je l'ai expliqué plus haut; les faits mathématiques dignes d'être étudiés, ce sont ceux qui, par leur analogie avec d'autres faits, sont susceptibles de nous conduire à la connaissance d'une loi mathématique de la même façon que les faits expérimentaux nous conduisent à 1a connaissance d'une loi physique. Ce sont ceuxqui nous révèlent des parentés insoupçonnées entre d'autres faits, connus depuis longtemps, mais qu'on croyait à tort étrangers les uns aux autres.Parmi les combinaisons que l'on choisira, les plus fécondes seront souvent celles qui sont formées d'éléments empruntés à des domaines très éloignés; et je ne veux pas dire qu'il suffise pour inventer de rapprocher des objets aussi disparates que possible; la plupart des combinaisons qu'on formerait ainsi seraient entièrement stériles ; mais quelques-unes d'entre elles, bien rares, sont les plus fécondes detoutes.Inventer, je l'ai dit, c'est choisir; mais le mot n'est peut-étre pas tout à fait juste, il fait penser à un acheteur à qui on présente un grand nombre d'échantillons et qui les examine l'un après l'autre de façon à faire son choix. Ici les échantillons seraient tellement nombreux qu'une vie entière ne suffirait pas pour les examiner. Ce n'est pas ainsi que les choses se passent. Les combinaisons stériles ne se présenteront même pas à l'esprit de l'inventeur. Dans le champ de sa conscience n'apparaîtront jamais que les combinaisons réellement utiles, et quelques-unes qu'il rejettera, mais qui participent un peu des caractères des combinaisons utiles. Tout se passe comme si l'inventeur était un examinateur du deuxième degré qui n'aurait plus à interroger que les candidats déclarés admissibles après une première épreuve.Mais ce que j'ai dit jusqu'ici, c'est ce qu'on peut observer ou inférer, en lisant les écrits des géo- mètres, à la condition de faire cette lecture avec quelque réflexion.Il est temps de pénétrer plus avant et de voir ce qui se passe dans l'âme même du mathématicien. Pour cela, je crois que ce que j'ai de mieux à faire, c'est de rappeler des souvenirs personnels. Seule- ment, je vais me circonscrire et vous raconter com- ment j'ai écrit mon premier mémoire sur les fonc- tions fuchsiennes. Je vous demande pardon, je vais employer quelques expressions techniques, mais elles ne doivent pas vous effrayer, vous n'avez aucun besoin de les comprendre. Je dirai, par exemple, j'ai trouvé la démonstration de tel théorème dans telles circonstances, ce théorème aura un nom bar- bare, que beaucoup d'entre vous ne connaîtront pas,mais cela n'a aucune importance; ce qui est inté- ressant pour le psychologue, ce n'est pas le théo- rème, ce sont les circonstances.Depuis quinze jours, je m'efforçais de démontrer qu'il ne pouvait exister aucune fonction analogue à ce que j'ai appelé depuis les fonctions fuchsiennes; j'étais alors fort ignorant; tous les jours, je m'as- seyais à ma table de travail, j'y passais une heure ou deux, j'essayais un grand nombre de combinai-sos et je n'arrivais à aucun résultat. Un soir, je pris du café noir, contrairement à mon habitude, je ne pus m'endormir : les idées surgissaient en foule; je les sentais comme se heurter, jusqu'à ce que deux d'entre elles s'accrochassent, pour ainsi dire, pour former une combinaison stable. Le matin, j'avais éta- bli l'existence d'une classe de fonctions fuchsiennes, celles qui dérivent de la série hypergéométrique ; je n'eus plus qu'à rédiger les résultats, ce qui ne me prit que quelques heures.Je voulus ensuite représenter ces fonctions par le quotient de deux séries; cette idée fut parfaitement consciente et réfléchie ; l'analogie avec les fonctionselliptiques me guidait. Je me demandai quelles de- vaient être les propriétés de ces séries, si elles exis- taient, et j'arrivai sans difficulté à former les séries que j'ai appelées thétafuchsiennes.A ce moment, je quittai Caen, où j'habitais alors, pour prendre part à une course géologique entre- prise par l'École des Mines. Les péripéties du voyage me firent oublier mes travaux mathématiques ; arri- vés à Coutances, nous montâmes dans un omnibus pour je ne sais quelle promenade; au moment où je mettais le pied sur le marche-pied, l'idée me vint, sans que rien dans mes pensées antérieures parût m'y avoir préparé, que les transformations dont j'avais fait usage pour définir les fonctions fuch- siennes étaient identiques à celles de la géométrie non-euclidienne. Je ne fis pas la vérification; je n'en aurais pas eu le temps, puisque, à peine assis dans l'omnibus, je repris la conversation commenetait déjà quelque chose. Tout ce travail fut parfai- tement conscient.Là-dessus, je partis pour le Mont-Valérien, où je devais faire mon service militaire; j'eus donc des préoccupations très différentes. Un jour, en traver- sant le boulevard, la solution de la difficulté qui m'avait arrêté m'apparut tout à coup. Je ne cherchai pas à l'approfondir immédiatement, et ce fut seule- ment après mon service que je repris la question. J'avais tous les éléments, je n'avais qu'à les rassembler et à les ordonner. Je rédigeai donc mon mémoire délinitif d'un trait et sans aucunepeine.Je me bornerai à cet exemple unique, il est inutilede les multiplier , eu ce qui concerne mes autres recherches, j'aurais à faire des récits tout à fait ana- logues ; et les observations rapportées par d'autres mathématiciens dans l'enquête de l'Enseignement Mathématique ne pourraient que les confirmer.Ce qui frappera tout d'abord, ce sont ces appa- rences d'illumination subite, signes manifestes d'un long travail inconscient antérieur; le rôle de ce tra- vail inconscient dans l'invention mathématique me paraît incontestable, et on en trouverait des traces dans d'autres cas où il est moins évident. Souvent, quand on travaille une question difficile, on ne fait rien de bon la première fois qu'on se met à la be- sogne; ensuite on prend un repos plus ou moins long, et on s'asseoit de nouveau devant sa table. Pendant la première demi-heure, on continue à ne rien trouver et puis tout à coup l'idée décisive se presente à l'esprit. On pourrait dire que le travail conscient a été plus fructueux, parce qu'il a été interrompu et que le repos a rendu à l'esprit sa force et sa fraîcheur. Mais il est plus probable que ce repos a été rempli par un travail inconscient, et que le résultat de ce travail s'est révélé ensuite au géomètre, tout à fait comme dans les cas que j'ai cités; seulement la révélation, au lieu de se faire jour pendant une promenade ou un voyage, s'est produite pendant une période de travail conscient, mais indépendamment de ce travail qui joue tout au plus un rôle de déclanchement, comme s'il était l'aiguillon qui aurait excité les résultats déjà acquis pendant le repos, mais restés inconscients, à revêtir la forme consciente.Il y a une autre remarque à faire au sujet des conditions de ce travail inconscient : c'est qu'il n'est possible et en tout cas qu'il n'est fécond que s'il est d'une part précédé, et d'autre part suivi d'une pé- riode de travail conscient. Jamais (et les exemples que j'ai cités le prouvent déjà suffisamment) ces inspirations subites ne se produisent qu'après quel- ques jours d'efforts volontaires, qui ont paru abso- lument infructueux et où l'on a cru ne rien faire de bon, où il semble qu'on a fait totalement fausse route. Ces efforts n'ont donc pas été aussi stériles qu'on le pense, ils ont mis en branle la machine in- consciente, et, sans eux, elle n'aurait pas marché et n'aurait rien produit.La nécessité de la seconde période de travail consci nt, après l'inspiration, se comprend mieux .... \"(Science et method, Poincare)",

Published in May 1775, this memoir must have been written shortly after the preceding one, perhaps in the fall of 1773. It displays a real duality.

It is divided into two parts, statics and dynamics, each of which treats solid bodies and fluids separately. There are no diagrams. The methods pesented require only analytic operations, subordinated to a regular and uniform development. Each of the four sections begins with a historical account which is a model of the kind.Lagrange decided, however, that the work should have a second edition incorporating certain advances. In the Mémoires de l’Institut he had earlier published some essays that represented a last, brilliant contribution to the development of celestial mechanics. Among them were “Mémoire sur la théorie générale de la variation des constantes arbitraires dans tous les problèmes de la mécanique,”65 read on 13 March 1809, and “Second mémoire sur la théorie de la variation des constantess arbitraires dans les problémes de mécanique dans lequel o simplifie l’application des formules générales à ces problémes,”66 read on 19 February 1810.

      "text": "\"Another reason which makes a philosophy of science specially useful at the present time is the revolutionary progress, the sweeping away of what had seemed fixed landmarks, which has so far characterized this century, especially in physics. The conception of the \" working hypothesis,\" provisional, approximate, and merely use- ful, has more and more pushed aside the comfortable eighteenth century conception of \" laws of nature.\" Even the Newtonian dynamics, which for over two hundred years had seemed to embody a definite con- quest, must now be regarded as doubtful, and as probably only a first rough sketch of the ways of matter. And thus, in virtue of the very rapidity of our progress, a new theory of knowledge has to be sought, more tentative and more modest than that of more confident but less successful generations. Of this necessity Poincar^ was acutely conscious, and it gave to his writings a tone of doubt which was hailed with joy by sceptics and pragmatists. But he was in truth no sceptic : however conscious of the difficulty of attaining knowledge, he never admitted its impos- sibility. \" It is a mistake to believe,\" he said, \" that the love of truth is indistinguishable from the love of cer- tainty ;\" and again: \"To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions ; both dispense with the necessity of reflection,\" His was the active, eager doubt that inspires a new scrutiny, not the idle doubt that acquiesces contentedly in nescience- Two opposite and conflicting qualities are required for the successful practice of philosophy — comprehen- siveness of outlook, and minute, patient analysis. Both exist in the highest degree in Descartes and Leibniz ; but in their day comprehensiveness was less difficult than it is now. Since Leibniz, I do not know of any philosopher who has possessed both : broadly speaking, British philosophers have excelled in analysis, while those of the Continent have excelled in breadth and scope. In this respect, Poincare is no exception : in philosophy, his mind was intuitive and synthetic ; wonderfully skilful, it is true, in analysing a science until he had extracted its philosophical essence, and in combining this essence with those of other sciences, but not very apt in those further stages of analysis which fall within the domain of philosophy itself. He built wonderful edifices with the philosophic materials that he found ready to hand, but he lacked the patience and the minuteness of attention required for the crea- tion of new materials. For this reason, his philosophy, though brilliant, stimulating, and instructive, is not among those that revolutionize fundamentals, or com- pel us to remould our imaginative conception of the nature of things. In fundamentals, broadly speaking, he remained faithful to the authority of Kant. Readers of the following pages will not be surprised to learn tliat his criticisms of mathematical logic do not appear to me to be among the best parts of his work. He was already an old man when he became aware of the existence of this subject, and he was led, by certain indiscreet advocates, to suppose it in some way /opposed to those quick flashes of insight in mathe- matical discovery which he has so admirably described- No such opposition in fact exists ; but the misconcep- tion, however regrettable, was in no way surprising. To be always right is not possible in philosophy ; but Poincar^'s opinions, right or wrong, are always the expression of a powerful and original mind with a quite unrivalled scientific equipment ; a masterly style, great wit, and a profound devotion to the advance- ment of knowledge. Through these merits, his books supply, better than any others known to me, the growing need for a generally intelligible account of the philosophic outcome of modern science. \" (Russel's preface to the translation of Poincarre's Science and Method)",

Alors, toutes les fois que nous ramas- serions un nouveau caillou, il y aurait une grande probabilité pour qu'il soit formé de quelque subs- tance inconnue ; tout ce que nous saurions des autres cailloux ne vaudrait rien pour lui; devant chaque objet nouveau nous serions comme Tenfant qui vient de naître; comme lui nous ne pourrions qu'obéir à nos caprices ou à nos besoins ; dans un pareil monde, il n'y aurait pas de science ; peut-être la pensée et même la vie y seraient-elles impossibles, puisque révolution n'aurait pu y développer les ins- tincts conservateurs. Grâce à Dieu, il n'en est pas ainsi ; comme tous les bonheurs auxquels on est accoutumé, celui-là n'est pas apprécié à sa valeur. Le biologiste serait tout aussi embarrassé s'il n'y avait que des individus et pas d'espèce et si l'héré- dité ne faisait pas les fils semblables aux pères. Quels sont donc les faits qui ont chance de se renouveler ? Ce sont d'abord les faits simples. Il est clair que dans un fait complexe, mille circonstances sont réunies par hasard, et qu'un hasard bien moins vraisemblable encore pourrait seul les réunir de nouveau. Mais y a-t-il des faits simples et, s'il y en a, comment les reconnaître ? Qui nous dit que ce que Dious croyons simple ne recouvre pas une effroyable complexité ? Tout ce que nous pouvons dire, c'est que nous devons préférer les faits qui paraissent simples à ceux où notre œil grossier discerne des éléments dissemblables. Et alors, de deux choses Tune, ou bien cette simplicité est réelle, ou bien les éléments sont assez intimement mélangés pour ne pouvoir être distingués. Dans le premier cas, nous avons chance de rencontrer de nouveau ce même fait simple, soit dans toute sa pureté, soit entrant lui-même comme élément dans un ensemble com- plexe. Dans le second cas, ce mélange ihtime a également plus de chance de se reproduire qu'un assemblage hétérogène ; le hasard sait mélanger, il ne sait pas démêler, etpour faire avec des éléments multiples un édifice bien ordonné dans lequel on distingue quelque chose, il faut le faire exprès. Il y a donc peu de chance pour qu'un assemblage où on distingue quelque chose se reproduise jamais. Il y en a beaucoup au contraire pour qu'un mélange qui semble homogène au premier coup d'œil se renou- velle plusieurs fois. Les faits qui paraissent simples, même s'ils ne le sont pas, seront donc plus facile- ment ramenés par le hasard. \" (Science et methode, Poincare)",

Nevertheless, it enables us to demonstrate Bolzano’s theorem by virtue of which, for all sets of points situated upon a straight line between two definite points of the same line, there exists necessarily a point of condensation, that is to say, a limiting point. From a theoretical point of view, the value of this axiom is that it leads indirectly to the introduction of limiting points, and, hence, renders it possible to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the points of a segment and the system of real numbers.

Cela peut-il être regardé comme une vraie solution ? On raconte que NEWTON communiqua à LEIBNITZ un anagramme à peu près comme ceci : auuaalibbeeceii, etc. LEIBNITZ, naturellement, n'y comprit rien du tout ; mais nous qui avons la clef, nous savons que cet anagramme veut dire, en le traduisant dans le langage moderne: « Je sais intégrer toutes les équations différen- tielles, » et nous sommes amenés à nous dire que NEWTON avait bien de la chance ou qu'il se faisait de singulières illusions. Il voulait dire tout simplement qu'il pouvait former (par la méthode des coefficients indéterminés) une série de puissances satisfaisant formellement à l'équation proposée.Une semblable solution aujourd'hui ne nous satis- ferait plus, et cela pour deux raisons; parce que la convergence est trop lente et parce que les termes se succèdent sans obéir à aucune loi. Au contraire, la série 6 nous paraît ne rien laisser à désirer, d'abord parce qu'elle converge très vite (cela, c'est pour le praticien qui désire avoir son nombre le plus promp- temeut possible) et ensuite parce que nous aperce- -ons d'un coup d'oeil la loi des temps (cela, c'est pour satisfaire aux besoins esthétiques du théo- ricien).Mais alors il n'y a plus des problèmes résolus et d'autres qui ne le sont pas; il y a seulement des problèmes plus ou moins résolus, selon qu'ils le sont par une série de convergence plus ou moins rapide, ou régie par une loi plus ou moins harmonieuse.

Le sentiment de la continuité est un guide précieux qui fait défaut à l'arithméticien ; chaque nombre entier est séparé des autres, il a pour ainsi dire son individualité propre ; chacun d'eux est une sorte d'exception et c'est pourquoi les théorèmes généraux seront plus rares dans la théorie des nombres, c'est pourquoi aussi ceux qui existent seront plus cachés et échap- peront plus longtemps aux chercheurs.Si l'arithmétique est en retard sur l'algèbre et sur l'analyse, ce qu'elle a de mieux à faire c'est de chercher à se modeler sur ces sciences afin de pro- fiter de leur avance. L'arithméticien doit donc prendre pour guide les analogies avec l'algèbre. Ces analogies sont nombreuses et si, dans bien des cas, elles n'ont pas encore été étudiées d'assez près pour devenir utilisables, elles sont au moins pressenties depuis longtemps et le langage même des deux sciences montre qu'on les a aperçues. C'est ainsi qu'on parle de nombres transcendants, et qu'on se rend compte ainsi que la classification future de ces nombres a déjà pour image la classification des fonc- tions transcendantes, et cependant on ne voit pas encore très bien comment on pourra passer d'une classification à l'autre; mais si on l'avait vu, cela seraitdéjà fait, et ce ne serait plus l'œuvre de l'avenir.e premier exemple qui me vient à l'esprit est la théorie des congruences, où l'on trouve un paral- lélisme parfait avec celle des équations algébriques. Certainement, ou arrivera à compléter ce parallé- lisme, qui doit subsister par exemple entre la théorie des courbes algébriques et celle des congruences à deux variables. Et quand les pro- blèmes relatifs aux congruences à plusieurs variables seront résolus, ce sera un premier pas vers la solu- tion de beaucoup de questions d'analyse indéter-minée.L'ALGEBRE.La théorie des équations algébriques retiendra encore longtemps l'attention des géomètres ; les côtés par où on peut l'aborder sont nombreux et divers.Il ne faut pas croire que l'algèbre soit terminée parce qu'elle nous fournit des règles pour former toutes les combinaisons possibles ; il reste à cher- cher les combinaisons intéressantes, celles qui satis- font à telle ou telle condition. Ainsi se constituera une sorte d'analyse indéterminée où les inconnues ne seront plus des nombres entiers, mais des poly- nômes. C'est alors cette fois l'algèbre qui prendra modèle sur l'arithmétique, en se guidant sur l'ana- logie du nombre entier, soit avec le polynôme entier à coefficients quelconques, soit avec le poly- nôme entier à coefficients entiers.LA GEOMETRIEIl semble que la géométrie ne puisse rien contenir qui ne soit déjà dans l'algèbre ou dans l'analyse ; que les faits géométriques, ne soient autre chose que les faits algébriques ou analytiques exprimés dans un autre langage. On pourrait donc croire qu'après la revue que nous venons de passer, il ne nous res- tera plus rien à dire qui se rapporte spécialement à la géométrie. Ce serait méconnaître l'importance même d'un langage bien fait, ne pas comprendre ce qu'ajoute aux choses elles-mêmes la façon d'exprimer ces choses et par conséquent de les grouper.D'abord les considérations géométriques nous amènent à nous poser de nouveaux problèmes ; ce sont bien, si l'on veut, des problèmes analytiques, mais que nous ne nous serions jamais posés a propos d'analyse. L'analyse en profite cependant comme elle profite de ceux qu'elle est obligée de résoudre pour satisfaire aux besoins de la Phy- sique.Un grand avantage de la géométrie, c'est précisé- ment que les sens y peuvent venir au secours de l'intelligence, et aident à deviner la route à suivie et bien des esprits préfèrent ramener les problèmes d'analyse à la forme géométrique. Malheureusement, nos sens ne peuvent nous mener bien loin, et ils nous faussent compagnie dès que nous voulons nous envoler en dehors des trois dimensions classiques. Est-ce à dire que, sortis de ce domaine restreint où ils semblent vouloir nous enfermer, nous ne devons plus compter que sur l'analyse pure et que toute géométrie à plus de trois dimensions est vaine et sans objet? Dans la génération qui nous a précédés, les plus grands maîtres auraient répondu « oui » ; nous sommes aujourd'hui tellement familiarisés avec cette notion que nous pouvons en parler, même dans un cours d'université, sans provoquer trop d'éton- nement.Mais à quoi peut-elle servir ? Il est aisé de le voir : elle nous donne d'abord un langage très com- mode, qui exprime en ternies très concis ce que le langage analytique ordinaire dirait en phrases pro- lixes. De plus, ce langage nous fait nommer du même nom ce qui se ressemble et affirme des ana- logies qu'il ne nous laisse plus oublier. Il nous permet donc encore de nous diriger dans cet espace qui est trop grand pour nous et que nous ne pou- vons voir, en nous rappelant sans cesse l'espace visible qui n'en est qu'une image imparfaite sans doute, mais qui en est encore une image. Ici encore, comme dans tous les exemples précédents, c'est l'analogie avec ce qui est simple qui nous permet de comprendre ce qui est complexe.Cette géométrie à plus de trois dimensions n'est pas une simple géométrie analytique, elle n'est pas purement quantitative, elle est aussi qualitative et c'est par là surtout qu'elle devient intéressante. Il y a une science qu'on appelle l'Analysis Situs et qui a pour objet l'étude des relations de position des divers éléments d'une figure, asbtraction faite de leurs grandeurs. Cette géométrie est purement qua- litative ; ses théorèmes resteraient vrais si les ligures, au lieu d'être exactes, étaient grossièrement imitées par un e.nfint. On peut faire aussi une Ana- lyses Situs à plus de trois dimensions. L'importance de l'Analysis Situs est énorme et je ne saurais trop y insister; le parti qu'en a tiré RIEMANN, l'un de ses principaux créateurs, suffirait à le démontrer. Il faut qu'on arrive à la construire complètement dans les espaces supérieurs ; on aura alors un instrument qui permettra réellement de voir dans l'hyperespace et de suppléer à nos sens.Les problèmes de l'Analysis Situs ne se seraient peut-être pas posés si on n'avait parlé que le lan- gage analytique ; ou plutôt, je me trompe, ils se seraient posés certainement, puisque leur solution est nécessaire à une foule de questions d'analyse; mais ils se seraient posés isolément, les uns après les autres, et sans qu'on puisse apercevoir leur lien commun.\" (Science et methode, Poincare)",

Un soir, je pris du café noir, contrairement à mon habitude, je ne pus m'endormir : les idées surgissaient en foule; je les sentais comme se heurter, jusqu'à ce que deux d'entre elles s'accrochassent, pour ainsi dire, pour former une combinaison stable. Le matin, j'avais éta- bli l'existence d'une classe de fonctions fuchsiennes, celles qui dérivent de la série hypergéométrique ; je n'eus plus qu'à rédiger les résultats, ce qui ne me prit que quelques heures.Je voulus ensuite représenter ces fonctions par le quotient de deux séries; cette idée fut parfaitement consciente et réfléchie ; l'analogie avec les fonctionselliptiques me guidait. Je me demandai quelles de- vaient être les propriétés de ces séries, si elles exis- taient, et j'arrivai sans difficulté à former les séries que j'ai appelées thétafuchsiennes.A ce moment, je quittai Caen, où j'habitais alors, pour prendre part à une course géologique entre- prise par l'École des Mines. Les péripéties du voyage me firent oublier mes travaux mathématiques ; arri- vés à Coutances, nous montâmes dans un omnibus pour je ne sais quelle promenade; au moment où je mettais le pied sur le marche-pied, l'idée me vint, sans que rien dans mes pensées antérieures parût m'y avoir préparé, que les transformations dont j'avais fait usage pour définir les fonctions fuch- siennes étaient identiques à celles de la géométrie non-euclidienne.

Dégoûté de mon insuccès, j'allai passer quelques jours au bord de la mer, et je pensai à tout autre chose. Un jour, en me promenant sur la falaise, l'idée me vint, toujours avec les mêmes caractères de brièveté, de soudaineté et de certitude immédiate, que les transformations arith- métiques des formes quadratiques ternaires indéfi- finies étaient identiques à celles de la géométrie non- euclidienne.Étant revenu à Caen, je réfléchis sur ce résultat, et j'en tirai les conséquences ; l'exemple des formes quadratiques me montrait qu'il y avait des groupes fuchsiens autres que ceux qui correspondent à la série hypergéométrique; je vis que je pouvais leur appliquer la théorie des séries thétafuchsiennes et que, par conséquent, il existait des fonctions fuch- siennes autres que celles qui dérivent de la série hypergéométrique, les seules que je connusse jus- qu'alors.

In 1621, the Greek text of DIOPHANTUS was published by BACHET, along with a useful Latin translation and an extensive commentary. IT is not known when FERMAT acquired a copy of this book (the same one, no doubt, into whose margins he was later to jot down some of his best discoveries), not when he began to read it; but by 1636, as we learn from his correspondence, he had not only studied it carefully but was already developing ideas of his own about a variety of topics touched upon in that volume.From then on, \"numbers\", i.e, number theory, never ceased to be among Fermat's major interests; but his valiant efforts to gain friends for his favorite subject were not, on the whole, crowned with success. \"There is no lack of better topics for us to spend our time on\" was young HUYGEN's comment to WALLIS. At one time Fermat cherished the thought of devoting a whole book to number theory. On another occasion he tried to persuade PASCAL to collaborate with him in writing such a book; of course, he realized the Pascal's gifts of exposition were far superior to his own. To our great loss, Pascal showed no interest and politely declined the suggestion; his views may well have been similar to those of Huygens. After Fermat's death in 16665, there was a great demand for a publication of his writings, hardly any of which had ever appeared in print. In 1670, his son Samuel published a reprint of Bachet's Diophantus, along with Fermat's marginal notes and an essay by the Jesuite father Jacques be BILLY on Fermat's methods for solving certain types of so-called Diophantine equations. This was followed in 1679 by the publication, also by Samuel, of a volume of his father's Varia Opera, including few letters of arithmetical content. But it took half a century for this to have any effect, and in the meanwhile number theory seemed to have died off.As to its rebirth, we can pinpoint it quire accurately. In 1729, young EULER was in St. Petersburg, an adjunct of the newly founded Academy of Sciences; his friend and patron GOLDBACH was in Moscow. Their correspondence has been carefully preserved and was published by Euler's great-grandson in 1843. Goldbach, in his own amateurish way, was keenly interested in mathematics and particularly in \"numbers\"; it is in a letter to Euler that he stated the conjecture to which his name has remained attached. On the first of December 1729, Goldbach asked Euler for his views about Fermat's statement that all integers 2^(2n)+1 are primes. In his answer, Euler expresses some doubts; but nothing new occurs until the fourth of June, when Euler reports that he has \"just been reading Fermat\" and that he has been greatly impressed by Fermat's assertion that every integer is a sum of four squares (and also of 3 triangular numbers, of 5 pentagonal numbers, etc.). After that day, Euler never lost sight of this topic and of number theory in general; eventually LAGRANGE followed suit, then LEGENDRE, then GAUSS with whom number theory reached full maturity.

Around 600 AD he used this technique in producing the so-called Hua ́ng j ́ı l`ı, or “Imperial Standard Calendar”. According to L ̆ı Y ̆an & Du` Sh ́ıra ́n [204], the formula involved in his computations reads, in modern notation:5ξ ξ2f(x0+ξT)=f(x0) + 2(∆1+∆2) + ξ(∆1−∆2) − 2(∆1−∆2), (1)with 0 &#x10fc7c; ξ < 1, T > 0, ∆1 = f(x0+T)−f(x0), and ∆2 = f(x0+2T)−f(x0+T), and with f(x0), f(x0 + T), and f(x0 + 2T) the observed results at times x0, x0 + T, and x0 + 2T, respectively. This formula is closely related to later Western interpolation formulae, to be discussed in the next section. Methods for second-order interpolation of unequal-interval observations were later used by the astronomer Monk Y`ı X ́ıng in producing the so-called “D`a Y ̆an Calendar” (727 AD) and by Xu ́ A ́ng in producing the “Xua ̄n M ́ıng Calendar” (822 AD). The latter also used a second-order formula for interpolation of equal-interval observations equivalent to the formula used by Liu` Zhu ́o.Accurate computation of the motion of celestial bodies, however, requires more sophis- ticated interpolation techniques than just second order. More complex techniques were later developed by Gu ̄o Sh ̆ouj`ıng and others. In 1280 AD they produced the so-called Sh`ou sh ́ı l`ı, or “Works and Days Calendar”, for which they used third-order interpolation. Although they did not write down explicitly third-order interpolation formulae, it follows from their computations recorded in tables that they had grasped the principle.Important contributions in the area of finite-difference computation were made by the Chinese mathematician Zhu ̄ Sh`ıji ́e.\" (Meijering, A Chronology of Interpolation)",

Although both of these increments vanish simultaneously, this is no obstacle to their ratios being determined as 1 to 2x. With respect to this nothing that so far has been represented by the letter ω, in differential calculus we use the symbol dx and call it the differential of x, since it is the increment of the quantity x. When we put dx for ω, the differential of x2 becomes 2x dx. In a similar way, it is shown that the differential of the cube x3 will be equal to 3x2 dx. In general, the differential of any quantity xn will be equal to nxn−1 dx. No matter what other functions of x might be proposed, differential calculus gives rules for finding its differential. Nevertheless, we must constantly keep in mind that since these differentials are absolutely nothing, we can conclude nothing from them except that their mutual ratios reduce to finite quantities. Thus, it is in this way that the principles of differential calculus, which are in agreement with proper reasoning, are established, and all of the objections that are wont to be brought against it crumble spontaneously; but these arguments retain their full rigor if the differentials, that is, the infinitely small, are not completely annihilated.\" (Euler, in Blanton's translation of Institutiones calculi differentialis) <Tag1>",

Concerning these, it is correctly objected that geometric rigor has been neglected. Because these infinitely small quantities have been neglected, the conclusions that have been drawn are rightly suspected. Although these in- finitely small quantities are conceived to be few in number, when even a few, or many, or even an innumerable number of these are neglected, an enormous error may result. There is an attempt wrongfully to refute this objection with examples of this kind, whereby conclusions are drawn from differential calculus in the same way as from elementary geometry. Indeed, if these infinitely small quantities, which are neglected in calculus, are not quite nothing, then necessarily an error must result that will be the greater the more these quantities are heaped up. If it should happen that the er- ror is less, this must be attributed to a fault in the calculation whereby certain errors are compensated by other errors, rather than freeing the cal- culation from suspicion of error. In order that there be no compensating one error by a new one, let me fix firmly the point I want to make with clear examples. Those quantities that shall be neglected must surely be held to be absolutely nothing. Nor can the infinitely small that is discussed in differential calculus differ in any way from nothing. Even less should this business be ended when the infinitely small is described by some with the example wherein the tiniest mote of dust is compared to a huge mountain or even to the whole terrestrial globe. If someone undertakes to calculate the magnitude of the whole terrestrial globe, it is the custom easily to grant him an error not only of a single grain of dust, but of even many thousands of these. However, geometric rigor shrinks from even so small an error, and this objection would be simply too great were any force granted to it. Then it is difficult to say what possible advantage might be hoped for in distinguishing the infinitely small from absolutely nothing. Perhaps they fear that if they vanish completely, then will be taken away their ratio, to which they feel this whole business leads. It is avowed that it is impossi- ble to conceive how two absolutely nothings can be compared. They think that some magnitude must be left for them that can be compared. They are forced to admit that this magnitude is so small that it is seen as if it were nothing and can be neglected in calculations without error. Neither do they dare to assign any certain and definite magnitude, even though incompre- hensibly small. Even if they were assumed to be two or three times smaller, the comparisons are always made in the same way. From this it is clear that this magnitude gives nothing necessary for undertaking a comparison, and so the comparison is not taken away even though that magnitude vanishes completely.\" (Euler, in Blanton's translation of Institutiones calculi differentialis) <Tag1>",

Then gradually this knowledge grew, but it was not all of a sudden that it has arrived at the summit to which it has now come. Even now, there is more that remains obscure than what we see clearly. As differential calculus is extended to all kinds of functions, no matter how they are pro-duced, it is not immediately known what method is to be used to compare the vanishing increments of absolutely all kinds of functions. Gradually this discovery has progressed to more and more complicated functions. For example, for the rational functions, the ultimate ratio that the vanishing increments attain could be assigned long before the time of Newton and Leibniz, so that the differential calculus applied to only these rational func- tions must be held to have been invented long before that time. However, there is no doubt that Newton must be given credit for that part of differ- ential calculus concerned with irrational functions. This was nicely deduced from his wonderful theorem concerning the general evolution of powers of a binomial. By this outstanding discovery, the limits of differential calculus have been marvelously extended. We are no less indebted to Leibniz insofar as this calculus at that time was viewed as individual tricks, while he put it into the form of a discipline, collected its rules into a system, and gave a crystal-clear explanation. From this there followed great aids in the further development of this calculus, and some of the open questions whose an- swers were sought were pursued through certain definite principles. Soon, through the studies of both Leibniz and the Bernoullis, the bounds of dif- ferential calculus were extended even to transcendental functions, which had in part already been discussed. Then, too, the foundations of integral calculus were firmly established. Those who followed in the elaboration of this field continued to make progress. It was Newton who gave very com- plete papers in integral calculus, but as to its first discovery, which can hardly be separated from the beginnings of differential calculus, it cannot with absolute certainty be attributed to him. Since the greater part has yet to be developed, it is not possible to say at this time that this calculus has absolutely been discovered. Rather, let us with a grateful mind acknowl- edge each one according to his efforts toward its completion.

Whether they call the vanishing increments whose ratios are under consideration by the name differentials or fluxions, these are always understood to be equal to zero, and this must be the true notion of the infinitely small. From this it follows that everything that has been debated about differentials of the second and higher orders, and this has been more out of curiosity then of usefulness, comes back to something very clear, namely, that when everything vanishes together we must con- sider the mutual ratio rather than the individual quantities. Since the ratio between the vanishing increments of the functions is itself expressed by some function, and if the vanishing increment of this function is compared with others, the result must be considered as the second differential. In this way, we must understand the development of differentials of higher orders, in such a way that they always are seen to be truly finite quantities and that this is the only proper way for them to be represented. At first sight, this description of analysis of the infinite may seem, for the most part, both shallow and extremely sterile, although that obscure notion of the infinitely small hardly offers more. In truth, if the ratios that connect the vanishing increments of any functions are clearly known, then this knowledge very of- ten is of the utmost importance and frequently is so important in extremely arduous investigations that without it almost nothing can be clearly un- derstood. For instance, if the question concerns the motion of a shot fired from a cannon, the air resistance must be known in order to know what the motion will be through a finite distance, as well as both the direction of the path at the beginning and also the velocity, on which the resistance depends. But this changes with time. However, the less distance the shot travels, the less the variation, so that it is possible more easily to come to knowledge of the true relationship. In fact, if we let the distance vanish, since in that case both the difference in direction and change in velocity also are removed, the effect of resistance produced at a single point in time, as well as the change in the path, can be defined exactly. When we know these instantaneous changes or, rather, since these are actually nothing, their mutual relationship, we have gained a great deal. Furthermore, the work of integral calculus is to study changing motion in a finite space. It is my opinion that it is hardly necessary to show further the uses of differen- tial calculus and analysis of the infinite, since it is now sufficiently noted, if even a cursory investigation is made. If we want to study more carefully the motion of either solids or fluids, it cannot be accomplished without analysis of the infinite. Indeed, this science has frequently not been suf- ficiently cultivated in order that the matter can be accurately explained. Throughout all the branches of mathematics, this higher analysis has pen- etrated to such an extent that anything that can be explained without its intervention must be esteemed as next to nothing.\" (Euler, in Blanton's translation of Institutiones calculi differentialis) <Tag1>",

There is no doubt that any quantity can be diminished until it all but vanishes and then goes to nothing. But an infinitely small quantity is nothing but a vanishing quantity, and so it is really equal to 0. There is also a definition of the infinitely small quantity as that which is less than any assignable quantity. If a quantity is so small that it is less than any assignable quantity, then it cannot not be 0, since unless it is equal to 0 a quantity can be assigned equal to it, and this contradicts our hypothesis. To anyone who asks what an infinitely small quantity in mathematics is, we can respond that it really is equal to 0. There is really not such a great mystery lurking in this idea as some commonly think and thus have rendered the calculus of the infinitely small suspect to so many. In the meantime any doubts that may remain will be removed in what follows, where we are going to treat this calculus.84. Since we are going to show that an infinitely small quantity is really zero, we must first meet the objection of why we do not always use the same symbol 0 for infinitely small quantities, rather than some special ones. Since all nothings are equal, it seems superfluous to have different signs to designate such a quantity. Although two zeros are equal to each other, so that there is no difference between them, nevertheless, since we have two ways to compare them, either arithmetic or geometric, let us look at quotients of quantities to be compared in order to see the difference. The arithmetic ratio between any two zeros is an equality. This is not the case with a geometric ratio. We can easily see this from this geometric proportion 2 : 1 = 0 : 0, in which the fourth term is equal to 0, as is the third. From the nature of the proportion, since the first term is twice the second, it is necessary that the third is twice the fourth.85. These things are very clear, even in ordinary arithmetic. Everyone knows that when zero is multiplied by any number, the product is zero and that n·0 = 0, so that n : 1 = 0 : 0. Hence, it is clear that any two zeros can be in a geometric ratio, although from the perspective of arithmetic, the ratio is always of equals. Since between zeros any ratio is possible, in order to indicate this diversity we use different notations on purpose, especially when a geometric ratio between two zeros is being investigated. In the calculus of the infinitely small, we deal precisely with geometric ratios of infinitely small quantities. For this reason, in these calculations, unless we use different symbols to represent these quantities, we will fall into the greatest confusion with no way to extricate ourselves.\" (Euler, in Blanton's translation of Institutiones calculi differentialis) <Tag2>",

For this reason these two infinitely small quantities dx and adx, both being equal to 0, cannot be confused when we consider their ratio.

If, as is commonly the case, we take the sum of a series to be the aggregate of all of its terms, actually taken together, then there is no doubt that only infinite series that converge continually closer to some fixed value, the more terms we actually add, can have sums. However, divergent series, whose terms do not decrease, whether their signs + and − alternate or not, do not really have fixed sums, supposing we use the word sum for the aggregate of all of the terms. Consider these cases that we have recalled, with erroneous sums, for example the finite expression 1/(1−x) for the infinite series 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · . The truth of the matter is this, not that the expression is the sum of the series, but that the series is derived from the expression. In this situation the name sum could be completely omitted.111. These inconveniences and apparent contradictions can be avoided if we give the word sum a meaning different from the usual. Let us say that the sum of any infinite series is a finite expression from which the series can be derived. In this sense, the true sum of the infinite series 1+x+x2 +x3 +· · · is 1/ (1 − x), since this series is derived from the fraction, no matter what value is substituted for x. With this understanding, if the series is convergent, the new definition of sum agrees with the usual definition. Since divergent series do not have a sum, properly speaking, there is no real difficulty which arises from this new meaning.

Hence, this case, in which the whole of analysis of the infinite is contained, should be distinguished from the method of differences. We use special names and notation for the infinitely small differences. With Leibniz we call infinitely small differences by the name differentials. From the discussion in the first chapter on the different orders of differences, we can easily understand the meaning of first, second, third, and so forth, differentials of any function. Instead of the symbol ∆, by which we previously indicated a difference, now we will use the symbol d, so that dy signifies the first differential of y, d2y the second differential, d3y the third differential, and so forth.115. Since the infinitely small differences that we are now discussing we call differentials, the whole calculus by means of which differentials are investigated and applied has usually been called differential calculus. The English mathematicians (among whom Newton first began to develop this new branch of analysis, as did Leibniz among the Germans) use different names and symbols. They call infinitely small differences, which we call differentials, fluxions and sometimes increments. These words seem to fit better in Latin, and they signify reasonably well the things themselves. A variable quantity by continuously increasing takes on various different values, and for this reason can be thought of as being in flux, from which comes the word fluxion.

Thus, dx2 does not express the differential of x2, but the square of the differential of x, so that the exponent 2 refers not to x but to dx. We could write this as dxdx in the same way as we would write the product of two differentials dx and dy as dxdy. The previous method, dx2, has the advantage of being both briefer and more usual. Especially if it is a question of higher powers of dx, the method of repeating so many times tends to be too long. Thus, dx3 denotes the cube of dx; we observe the same reasoning with regard to differentials of higher order. For example, d2y4 denotes the fourth power of the second-order differential d2y, and d3y2√x symbolizes the product of the square of the differential of the third order of y and √x. If it were the product with the rational quantity x then we would write it as xd3y2.146. If we want the symbol d to affect more than the next letter, we need a special way of indicating that. In this case we will use parentheses to in- clude the expression whose differential we need to express. Then d &#x10fc01;x2 + y2&#x10fc02; means the differential of the quantity x2 + y2. It is true enough that if we want to designate the differential of a power of such an expression, then ambiguity can hardly be avoided.

To this last group belong a line segment, whose measure is its length; a planar region, associated with its area; and a rotation, measured by its angle.There is a certain ambiguity in the concept of angle, for it de- scribes both the qualitative idea of “separation” between two in- tersecting lines, and the numerical value of this separation—the measure of the angle.

Fortunately we need not worry about this ambiguity, for trigonometry is con- cerned only with the quantitative aspects of line segments and angles.1The common unit of angular measure, the degree, is believed to have originated with the Babylonians. It is generally assumed that their division of a circle into 360 parts was based on the closeness of this number to the length of the year, 365 days. Another reason may have been the fact that a circle divides nat- urally into six equal parts, each subtending a chord equal to the radius (fig. 4). There is, however, no conclusive evidence to sup- port these hypotheses, and the exact origin of the 360-degree system may remain forever unknown.2 In any case, the system fitted well with the Babylonian sexagesimal (base 60) numera- tion system, which was later adopted by the Greeks and used by Ptolemy in his table of chords (see chapter 2).\" (Maor, Trigonometric Delights) <Tag3>",

To classify stars according to their brightness, Hipparchus in- troduced a scale in which the brightest stars were given magni- tude 1 and the faintest magnitude 6; this scale, though revised and greatly extended in range, is still being used today. Hip- parchus is also credited with discovering the precession of the equinoxes—a slow circular motion of the celestial poles once every 26,700 years; this apparent motion is now known to be caused by a wobble of the earth’s own axis (it was Newton who correctly explained this phenomenon on the basis of his theory of gravitation). \" (Maor, Trigonometric Delights)",

      "text": "\"The theory of proportions is credited to Eudoxus (around 400–350 bce) and is expounded in Book V of Euclid’s Elements. The purpose of the theory is to enable lengths (and other geometric quantities) to be treated as precisely as numbers, while admitting only the use of rational numbers. We saw the motivation for this in Section 1.5: the Greeks could not accept irrational numbers, but they accepted irrational geometric quantities such as the diagonal of the unit square. To simplify the exposition of the theory, let us call lengths rational if they are rational multiples of a fixed length.The idea of Eudoxus was to say that a length λ is determined by those rational lengths less than it and those greater than it. To be precise, he says λ1 = λ2 if any rational length <λ1 is also <λ2, and vice versa. Likewise λ1 < λ2 if there is a rational length >λ1 but <λ2. This definition uses the rationals to give an infinitely sharp notion of length while avoiding any overt use of infinity. Of course the infinite set of rational lengths <λ is present in spirit, but Eudoxus avoids mentioning it by speaking of an arbitrary rational length <λ.The theory of proportions was so successful that it delayed the development of a theory of real numbers for 2000 years. This was ironic,because the theory of proportions can be used to define irrational numbers just as well as lengths. It was understandable though, because the common irrational lengths, such as the diagonal of the unit square, arise fromconstructions that are intuitively clear and finite from the geometric point of view. Any arithmetic approach to sqrt(2), whether by sequences, decimals, or continued fractions, is infinite and therefore less intuitive. Until the 19th century this seemed a good reason for considering geometry to be a better foundation for mathematics than arithmetic. Then the problems of geometry came to a head, and mathematicians began to fear geometric in- tuition as much as they had previously feared infinity. There was a purge of geometric reasoning from the textbooks and industrious reconstruction of mathematics on the basis of numbers and sets of numbers. Set theory is discussed further in Chapter 24. Suffice to say, for the moment, that set theory depends on the acceptance of completed infinities.\"The beauty of the theory of proportion was its adaptability to this new climate. Instead of rational lengths, take rational numbers. Instead of comparing existing irrational lengths by means of rational lengths, construct irrational numbers from scratch using sets of rationals! The length sqrt(2) is determined by the two sets of positive rationals L√2 ={r:r2 <2}, U√2 ={r:r2 >2}. Dedekind (1872) decided to let sqrt(2) be this pair of sets! In general, let any partition of the positive rationals into sets L, U such that any member of L is less than any member of U be a positive real number. This idea, now known as a Dedekind cut, is more than just a twist of Eudoxus; it gives a complete and uniform construction of all real numbers, or points on the line, using just the rationals. In short, it is an explanation of the continuous in terms of the discrete, finally resolving the fundamental conflict in Greek mathematics. Dedekind was understandably pleased with his achievement. He wrote'The statement is so frequently made that the differential calcu- lus deals with continuous magnitude, and yet an explanation of this continuity is nowhere given. . . . It then only remained to discover its true origin in the elements of arithmetic and thus at the same time secure a real definition of the essence of continuity. I succeeded Nov. 24 1858.' Dedekind (1872), p. 2\"(Stillwell, Mathematics and Its History). <Tag3>Note by me: I found this while reflecting of the beautiful subtleties of cuts while studying them in the Zakon book. Per example, first defining the comparison of numbers in the completed field using set inclusion, which allows taking about supremums and infimums easily and comparing 'gap' numbers directly to rationals, and by the way showing that between any two different gaps there are rationals, that is subtly significant because it proves that a gap really defines exactly one 'new number' that 'fills it'. (Check: Another clever subtlety is using supremums only to define sums, etc.. while the direct naive approach would be to define them as cuts, the result is surely the same, but the definition chosen saves some work and improves proof elegance. )",

On the other hand, the algebraic integers in a field generated from a single algebraic number α of degree n,.....By drawing attention to the field Q(α) of degree n, Dedekind also brought to light some vector space structure: the basis 1,α,α2,...,αn−1 of Q[α], the linear independence of these basis elements over Q, and the dimension (equal to the degree) of Q[α] over Q. Despite the long history of linear algebra, dating back 2000 years in China at least, again it was the greater generality afforded by algebraic number theory that finally brought its fundamental concepts to light.The next level of abstraction was reached in the 20th century and it was (in a new twist to Kronecker’s words) the work of a woman, Emmy Noether. In the 1920s she developed concepts for discussing common properties of different algebraic structures, such as groups and rings. One of the things groups and rings have in common is homomorphisms, or structure-preserving maps. A map φ : G → G′ is a homomorphism of groups if φ(gh) = φ(g)φ(h) for any g,h ∈ G. Similarly, a map φ : R → R′ is a homomorphism of rings if φ(r + s) = φ(r) + φ(s) and φ(rs) = φ(r)φ(s) for any r, s ∈ R. From this higher vantage point, normal subgroups (Sec- tion 19.2) and ideals can be seen as instances of the same concept. Each is the kernel of a homomorphism φ: the set of elements mapped by φ to the identity element (1 for a group, 0 for a ring).\" (Stillwell, Mathematics and Its History). <Origins>",

Alexander is said to have asked Menaechmus for a crash course in geometry, but Menaechmus refused, saying, “There is no royal road to geometry.” Menaechmus used conic sections to give a very simple solution to the problem of duplicating the cube. In analytic notation, this can be described as finding theintersection of the parabola y = 1 x2 with the hyperbola xy = 1. This yields 2 x1x2 =1 or x3 =2. 2Although the Greeks accepted this as a “construction” for duplicating the cube, they apparently never discussed instruments for actually drawing conic sections. This is very puzzling since a natural generalization of the compass immediately suggests itself (Figure 2.8). The arm A is set at a fixed position relative to a plane P, while the other arm rotates about it at a fixed angle θ, generating a cone with A as its axis of symmetry. The pencil, which is free to slide in a sleeve on this second arm, traces the section of the cone lying in the plane P. According to Coolidge (1945), p. 149, this instrument for drawing conic sections was first described as late as 1000 ce by the Arab mathematician al-Kuji.

      "text": "\"Reasoning about infinity is one of the characteristic features of mathemat- ics as well as its main source of conflict. We saw, in Chapter 1, the conflict that arose from the discovery of irrationals, and in this chapter we shall see that the Greeks’ rejection of irrational numbers was just part of a gen- eral rejection of infinite processes. In fact, until the late 19th century most mathematicians were reluctant to accept infinity as more than “potential.” The infinitude of a process, collection, or magnitude was understood as the possibility of its indefinite continuation, and no more—certainly not the possibility of eventual completion. For example, the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, . . ., can be accepted as a potential infinity—generated from 1 by the process of adding 1—without accepting that there is a completed totality {1, 2, 3, . . .}. The same applies to any sequence x1, x2, x3, . . . (of rational numbers, say), where xn+1 is obtained from xn by a definite rule.And yet a beguiling possibility arises when xn tends to a limit x. If x is something we already accept—for geometric reasons, say—then it is very tempting to view x as somehow the “completion” of the sequence x1, x2, x3, . . . . It seems that the Greeks were afraid to draw such conclu- sions. According to tradition, they were frightened off by the paradoxes of Zeno, around 450 bce.We know of Zeno’s arguments only through Aristotle, who quotes them in his Physics in order to refute them, and it is not clear what Zeno himself wished to achieve. Was there, for example, a tendency toward speculation about infinity that he disapproved of? His arguments are so extreme they could almost be parodies of loose arguments about infinity he heard among his contemporaries. Consider his first paradox, the dichotomy:There is no motion because that which is moved must arrive at the middle (of its course) before it arrives at the end.Aristotle, Physics, Book VI, '\"Ch. 9The full argument presumably is that before getting anywhere one must first get half way, and before that a quarter of the way, and before that one eighth of the way, ad infinitum. The completion of this infinite sequence of steps no longer seems impossible to most mathematicians, since it rep- resents nothing more than an infinite set of points within a finite interval. It must have frightened the Greeks though, because in all their proofs they were very careful to avoid completed infinities and limits. The first mathematical processes we would recognize as infinite were probably devised by the Pythagoreans, for example, the recurrence rela- tionsxn+1 = xn + 2yn, yn+1 = xn + ynfor generating integer solutions of the equations x2 − 2y2 = ±1. We saw in Section 3.4 why it is likely that these relations arose from an attempt to understand sqrt(2) ,and it iseasy forus to see that xn/yn → sqrt(2) asn→∞.However, it is unlikely that the Pythagoreans would have viewed 2 as a “limit” or seen the sequence as a meaningful object at all. The most we can say is that, by stating a recurrence, the Pythagoreans implied a sequence with limit sqrt(2), but only a much later generation of mathematicians could accept the infinite sequence as such and appreciate its importance indefining the limit.In a problem where we would find it natural to reach a solution α by a limiting process, the Greeks would instead eliminate any solution but α. They would show that any number <α was too small and any number >α was too large to be the solution. In the following sections we shall study some examples of this style of proof and see how it ultimately bore fruit in the foundations of mathematics. As a method of finding solutions to problems, however, it was sterile: how does one guess the number α in the first place? When mathematicians returned to problems of finding limits in the 17th century, they found no use for the rigorous methods of the Greeks. The dubious 17th-century methods of infinitesimals were criticized by the Zeno of the time, Bishop Berkeley, but little was done to meet his objec- tions until much later, since infinitesimals did not seem to lead to incorrect results. It was Dedekind, Weierstrass, and others in the 19th century who eventually restored Greek standards of rigor.The story of rigor lost and rigor regained took an amazing turn when a previously unknown manuscript of Archimedes, The Method, was dis- covered in 1906. In it he reveals that his deepest results were found using dubious infinitary arguments, and only later proved rigorously. Because, as he says, “It is of course easier to supply the proof when we have previously acquired some knowledge of the questions by the method, than it is to find it without any previous knowledge.”The importance of this statement goes beyond its revelation that infinity can be used to discover results that are not initially accessible to logic.Archimedes was probably the first mathematician candid enough to explain that there is a difference between the way theorems are discovered and the way they are proved.\" (Stillwell, Mathematics and Its History).",

We know that the planets move on ellipses around the sun, the earth being one of them. We shall derive from these facts the apparent motions as seen from the earth. In order to simplify our discussion, we shall replace all orbits by circles whose common center is the sun. The eccenbicities of the elliptic orbits are so small that a seale drawing that would fit this page would not show the difference between the elliptic and the circular orbits.We utilize furthermore the fact that the dimensions of our planetary system are so minute in comparison with the distances to the fixed stars which constitute the background of the celestial sphere that we commit no observable error at all if we keep either the sun or the earth in a fixed position with respect to the surrounding universe. Hence we will proceed in the following way.We shall start with the circular motion of the planets around the sun and then keep the earth fixed and ask for the resulting motion with respect to the earth. This will answer our question concerning the planetary phenomena.The first step is absolutely trivial. We know that the earth is a satellite of the sun, moving around it once in a year. In order to obtain the appearances seen from the earth we subtract from all motions the motion of the earth. Thus we see that by arresting the motion of the earth we obtain the appearance that the sun moves around the earth once per year. Its apparent path is called the ecliptic (cf. Fig. 12a and b).Secondly we consider an \"inner\" planet. Mercury or Venus. which moves closer to the sun than the earth (Fig. 13a). If we stop the earth we need only repeat Fig. 12 in order to obtain again the motion of the sun. The orbit of the planet remains a circle with the sun in its center. Hence the geocentric description of the motion of an inner planet is given by a planet which moves on a little circle whose center is carried on a larger circle whose center is the earth. The little circle is called an \"epicycle\". the large circle is the \"deferent\". Finally we have an \"outer\" planet. Mars. Jupiter. or Saturn. whose orbit encloses the orbit of the earth (Fig. 14a). From the earth E the planet P appears to be moving on a circle whose center S moves around E. Thus we have again an epicyclic motion (Fig. 14b). In order to establish a closer similarity with the ease of the inner planets we introduce a point C such that the four points S. E. p. and C always form a parallelogram. SP is the radius of the planetary orbit; because EC = SP we see that C lies on a circle with center E. Similarly ES is the radius of the solar orbit, and, because ES = CP, we see that P lies on a circle around C. Thus the planet P moves on an epicycle whose center C travels on a deferent whose center is E (Fig. 14c). Thus we have established an exact analogue to the case of the inner planets. In both cases the planet has an epicyclic move- ment. In the case of the inner planets the center of the epicycle coincides with the sun. For the outer planets the center C of the epicycle moves around E with the same angular velocity as the planet moves around the sun, while the planet P moves on the epicycle around C with the same angular velocity as the sun moves around the earth.\" (Neugebauer.

Obviously one should know whether the three intermediate lunar months were. perhaps. all only 29 days long. or all three were 30 days long, etc. This question could be an- swered perfectly well by lunar ephemerides whose goal it was to determine whether a given month was 29 or 30 days long. But planetary phenomena proceed very slowly. One single table for Jupiter or Saturn could easily cover 60 years and more. To determine calendar dates so far in advance would have meant the computation of complete lunar ephemerides for several decades. Furthermore. the actual computation of the planetary motion had to be based. in any ease. on a uniform time seale. All these difficulties were at once overcome by a very clever device. One used as unit of time the mean synodic month anddivided it in 30 equal parts. The Babylonians seem not to have had a special name for these units. referring to them simply as udays\". Modern scholars have used the term \"lunar days\"; I shall use the corresponding term of Hindu astronomy. namely. utithi\" .The fact that the Babylonian calendar was a strictly lunar calendar has the effect that the total duration of a number of calendar months will not deviate more and more from the cor- responding total of mean SYnodic months. Dates expressed in tithis will never be far off from real calendar days. usually not more than ±1 day. Thus the Babylonian astronomers in their computations simply identified the results given in tithis with the dates in the real calendar. This is the standard procedure for all planetary texts.The use of tithis implies that one did not try to reach. for the planetary phenomena. the same accuracy which was obtained in the lunar theory. While one went to great lengths to determine all possible influences upon the first and last visibility of the moon. we find no similar devices used for the planetary phe- nomena.

Nobody would have had the idea that the moon could rotate on a circle around the earth and all philosophers would have declared it as a logical necessity that a moon shows six half moons between two full moons. And what could have happened with our concepts of time if we were members of a double-star system (perhaps with some uneven distribution of mass in our little satellite) is something that may be left to the imagination.Actually, however, the initial conditions of our planetary system were chosen in such a way that all the satellites of the sun-and our own satellite as well-behave with great modesty. Their orbits can be closely approximated by circles such that the simplest possible model of a circular motion with constant speed leads immediately to very reasonable results for the descrip- tion of the solar and lunar phenomena. On the other hand, the deviations from the trivial circular orbits are just great enough to be observed and to challenge an explanation, but small enough such that again comparatively simple modifications of the trivial solution give satisfactory results. The successive approximationsof the Babylonian lunar and planetary theory reflect this situation perfectly. At the basis lies the counting of the periodically recurrent phenomena; the properly chosen periodic functions-zigzag functions or step functions-suffice to describe the deviation from a trivial mean motion.\" (Neugebauer.

The then recent discovery of the sphericity of the earth must have suggested a corresponding sphericity of the sky and a circular motion of the celestial bodies. Eudoxus's theory may have well started from the following consideration. The motion of sun and moon can be described as the combination of the uniform motions of two concentric spheres: one is the fast daily rotation about the poles of the equator; the other is slow and proceeds in opposite direction about an inclined axis which is perpendicular to the ecliptic. Eudoxus saw that a similar combination is capable of explaining, at least qualitatively, also the most striking phenomenon of planetary motion, the retrogradations. The motion of two homo- centric spheres allows of two trivial limiting types. I f the two axes are made to coincide, the body which is fixed to the equator of one of the two spheres moves simply in a circle with the difference velocity. If, secondly, the two opposite velocities are made of equal amount the body remains stationary as seen from the center.But one case remains to be investigated: what motion results from equal opposite velocities but inclined axes? Eudoxus found that the orbit is an 8-shaped curve (Fig. 24). Now one can superimpose a third rotation about an axis which is perpendicular to the plane of sYmmetry which represents the plane of the ecliptic. Conse- quently, the point P no longer follows a closed curve but proceeds with a certain mean velocity in the ecliptic. Simultaneously, however, there appears a periodic deviation from the ecliptic, or a motion in latitude. Finally, one will obtain retrogradations if the longitudinal component is less than the backward motion in the original figure eight. Thus it is demonstrated that, at least qualitatively, even the apparent irregularities of planetary motion can be described by a combination of circular motions of uniform angular velocity.In spite of the great importance, in principle, of the discovery of Eudoxus, it is quite obvious that a model of this type has grave shortcomings.\" (Neugebauer.

We know. however. that Apollonius (about 200 B.C.) used the simple device of viewing uniform circular motion. not from the center of the orbit. but from a slightly eccentric point. This obviously has the effect that the motion appears fastest where the circle is nearest to the observer and slowest at the opposite point. But Apollonius proved more. He demonstrated that an eccentric movement of this type can always be replaced by an epicyclic motion where the center of the epicycle moves on a circle with the observer at its center and with a radius of the epicycle equal to the eccentricity (cf.

The \"paradoxa\" concerning continuity, both of space and time, made the relation to the whole problem of determination of area and volume evident. One way out might have been the assumption of a somewhat atomistic structure of geometrical objects by means of which the problem of area or volume would have been reduced, though in not too clear a fashion, to a counting of discrete elements, \"atoms\".The reaction of the mathematicians against this type of specula- tion seems to have led to two major steps. First of all, one had to agree exactly on a system of basic assumptions from which alone the rest had to be deduced; this gave rise to the strictly axiomatic procedure. Secondly, it had become clear that one should consider the geometrical objects as the given entities such that the case of integer ratios appeared as a special case of only secondary interest; this led to the problem of how to formulate classical arithmetical and algebraic knowledge in geometrical language.

In other words he realized that the traditional lunar theory agreed with observations in the syzygies (conjunctions and oppositions) but could not explain longitudes near the quadratures, particularly for values of the anomaly\" near ±90°. In these cases the diameter of the epicycle seemed to be enlarged over the value found at the syzygies.The procedure which Ptolemy followed to cope with this situation is of interest in many respects.

Where this is so we know that it is caused by the action of some other force, such as the attraction of a great mass like a mountain, or by the gravitational pull of the moon, or by the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation. Dr. Xcvii Maskelvne, a British astronomer, found that when he suspended two plumb lines near a mountain, one on the north and the other on the south, the angle between their directions was greater than the angle between two vertical plumb lines should be. On measuring he found that each plumb line was pulled slightly toward the mountain.We can understand this; but in India a very strange thing happens. When a plumb line is suspended in the southern regions, it hangs quite vertically; but when taken north, it is pulled, not toward the Himalaya Mountains, but away from the massive mountains, toward the southern plain.This behavior of the plumb line, so different from what we should expect, is due to the fact that the weight of the great table- land of southern India. and the material lying beneath it, is greater than the weight of the Himalaya Mountains and the material below them. The heavy plain attracts the bob of the plumb line away from the lighter mountains, massive though they appear to the eye.

Additionally, the very local variations of the VD can be computed from gravimetric survey data and by means of digital terrain models (DTM), using a theory originally developed by Vening-Meinesz.VDs are used in astro-geodetic levelling, a geoid determination technique. As a vertical deflection describes the difference between the geoidal and ellipsoidal normals, it represents the horizontal gradient of the undulations of the geoid (i.e., the separation between geoid and reference ellipsoid). Given a starting value for the geoid undulation at one point, determining geoid undulations for an area becomes a matter for simple integration.In practice, the deflections are observed at special points with spacings of 20 or 50 kilometers. The densification is done by a combination of DTM models and areal gravimetry. Precise VD observations have accuracies of ±0.2″ (on high mountains ±0.5″), calculated values of about 1–2″.The maximal VD of Central Europe seems to be a point near the Großglockner (3,798 m), the highest peak of the Austrian Alps.

I regard the whole of arithmetic as a necessary, or at least natural, consequence of the simplest arithmetic act, that of counting, and counting it- self as nothing else than the successive creation of the infinite series of positive integers in which each individual is defined by the one immediately preceding; the simplest act is the passing from an already-formed individual to the con- secutive new one to be formed. The chain of these numbers forms in itself an exceedingly useful instrument for the human mind; it presents an inexhaustible wealth of remarkable laws obtained by the introduction of the four fundamental operations of arithmetic. Addition is the combination of any arbitrary repeti- tions of the above-mentioned simplest act into a single act; from it in a similar way arises multiplication. While the performance of these two operations is always possible, that of the inverse operations, subtraction and division, proves to be limited. Whatever the immediate occasion may have been, whatever com- parisons or analogies with experience, or intuition, may have led thereto; it is certainly true that just this limitation in performing the indirect operations has in each case been the real motive for a new creative act; thus negative and fractional numbers have been created by the human mind; and in the system of all rational numbers there has been gained an instrument of infinitely greater perfection. This system, which I shall denote by R, possesses first of all a com- pleteness and self-containedness which I have designated in another place1 as characteristic of a body of numbers [Zahlk ̈orper] and which consists in this that the four fundamental operations are always performable with any two individu- als in R, i. e., the result is always an individual of R, the single case of division by the number zero being excepted.\" (Dedekind, Contibuity and Irrational Numbers)",

If the point p corresponds to the rational number a, then, as is well known, the length op is commensurable with the invariable unit of measure used in the construction, i. e., there exists a third length, a so-called common measure, of which these two lengths are integral multiples. But the ancient Greeks already knew and had demonstrated that there are lengths incommensurable with a given unit of length, e. g., the diagonal of the square whose side is the unit of length. If we lay off such a length from the point o upon the line we obtain an end-point which corresponds to no rational number. Since further it can be easily shown that there are infinitely many lengths which are incommensurable with the unit of length, we may affirm: The straight line L is infinitely richer in point-individuals than the domain R of rational numbers in number-individuals.If now, as is our desire, we try to follow up arithmetically all phenomena in the straight line, the domain of rational numbers is insufficient and it becomes absolutely necessary that the instrument R constructed by the creation of the rational numbers be essentially improved by the creation of new numbers such that the domain of numbers shall gain the same completeness, or as we may say at once, the same continuity, as the straight line.The previous considerations are so familiar and well known to all that many will regard their repetition quite superfluous. Still I regarded this recapitulation as necessary to prepare properly for the main question.

Everything must depend on the answer to this question, and only through it shall we obtain a scientific basis for the investigation of all continu- ous domains.

This discovery will, perhaps, be differently estimated by different people; the majority may find its substance very commonplace. It consists of the following.In the preceding section attention was called to the fact that every point p of the straight line produces a separation of the same into two portions such that every point of one portion lies to the left of every point of the other. I find the essence of continuity in the converse, i. e., in the following principle:“If all points of the straight line fall into two classes such that every point of the first class lies to the left of every point of the second class, then there exists one and only one point which produces this division of all points into two classes, this severing of the straight line into two portions.”As already said I think I shall not err in assuming that every one will at once grant the truth of this statement; the majority of my readers will be very much disappointed in learning that by this commonplace remark the secret of continuity is to be revealed.

One important aspect of the identities of authors as projected by their texts is the extent to which and the manner in which they claim to be authoritative within their community. If an author appears too tentative in his or her claims, less value might be placed on the results, whereas if one appears inappropriately self-assured, a reader might question the author's right to be so certain and even dismiss the work. Terms such as \"clearly\" and \"obvious\" are relative to the individuals using them (implying that this information is obvious to me but may not be so obvious to you). Our interpretation that the use of such terms serves as a claim to authority on the part of the writer (implying that this derivation is clear to me and I do not need to explain it further because if it is not clear to you, that is your fault not mine) is reinforced by the interview data, as demonstrated in some of the earlier quotes. We believe that, whatever the author's intent, the extent or absence of such words is one of the interpersonal aspects of the writing that will influence the ways in which the readers of the text will construct an image of the author and will consequently judge the worth of the text itself. This section exhibits a curious switch that makes it hard to argue with. It begins by attributing an arrogant attitude to the user of \"clearly\", and describes that attitude twice, in parenthetical imagined monologue, but ends only by saying that \"whatever the author's intent\" might be, the use of such words will generate an image of some sort in the reader, only an image of the author, not necessarily the real thing. Is the author who uses \"clearly\" parading his authority or is he merely subjecting his prose to misinterpretation of his motives? Burton and Morgan get away with claiming both, I suppose. I cannot deny the latter reading, any more than I can deny that some circle-squarers consider my denial of their discovery a defensive act of authority. But I will nonetheless deny that \"clearly\" is used to put down the readers. I ask my own readers here to find, if they can, samples of articles in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society (say) exhibiting such behavior. It is hard for me to believe that the writers of this analysis of the prose of mathematical research have had much experience reading any of it for its mathematical content – or not successfully, at any rate. I must explain to them that \"clearly\" is an abbreviation for some statements that would take up unnecessary space, and perhaps, even probably, interrupt the exposition in such a way as to make it harder (not easier) to read and understand. Further, that the author who uses \"clearly\" generally knows the statement is not \"clear\" to everyone, not to one person in a million actually, for it only needs to be clear to those who have a good chance at understanding his piece at all.\" (http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/rarm/jrme0.html)",

      "text": "\"The study of the development of mathematical thinking is aided by several theoretical concepts to support our analysis. The human brain is highly sophisticated, but it is also surprisingly limited, being able to deal with only a small number of pieces of information at a time. In his famous paper, Miller (1956) suggested the number is around 7±2, based on a review of many articles published at the time. Personally I feel that it is much smaller than this; perhaps I could cope with more when I was younger – but I can’t remember.The human brain copes with this by connecting ideas together into ‘thinkable concepts’. (Although all concepts are clearly thinkable, I use the two words together to focus on how the concept is held in the mind as a single entity at a single time.)Compression into thinkable concepts occurs in several different ways. One, discussed by Lakoff (1987) in his book Women Fire and Dangerous Things, is categorisation, where concepts are connected in various ways in a category that itself becomes a thinkable concept. Sometimes the category may be represented by a specific case operating in a generic capacity such the equality 3 + 4 = 4 + 3 representing commutativity of addition.Another mode of compression, described by Dubinsky and his colleagues (Cottrill et al, 1996), occurs in APOS theory where an ACTION is internalised as a PROCESS and is encapsulated into an OBJECT, connected to other knowledge within a SCHEMA; they also note that a SCHEMA may also be encapsulated as an OBJECT.Following Davis (1983, p. 257), who used the term ‘procedure’ to mean a specific sequence of steps and a process as the overall input-output relationship that may be implemented by different procedures, Gray, Pitta, Pinto & Tall (1999) represented the successive compression from procedure through multi-procedure, process and procept, expanded in figure 3 to correspond to the SOLO taxonomy sequence: unistructural, multi- structural, relational, extended abstract, (Pegg & Tall, 2005).This models the way in which a procedure—as a sequence of steps performed in time—is steadily enriched by developing alternative procedures to allow an efficient choice. The focus switches from the individual steps to the overall process, and may then be compressed as a procept to think about and to manipulate mentally in a flexible way.Some students who have difficulty may become entrenched in a procedural approach, perhaps reaching a multi-procedural stage that can lead to procedural efficiency. Other students develop greater flexibility by seeing processes as a whole and compressing operations into thinkable concepts. This can lead to a spectrum of outcomes within a single group of learners between those who perform procedurally and those who develop greater flexibility. In arithmetic, Gray & Tall (1994) called this the proceptual divide.The earlier work of Dubinsky and his colleagues (e.g. Cottrill et al., 1996) focused initially on a symbolic approach by programming a procedure as a function and then using the function as the input to another function. The data shows that, while the process level was often attained, encapsulation from process to object was more problematic.A curriculum that focuses on symbolism and not on related embodiments may limit the vision of the learner who may learn to perform a procedure, even conceive of it as an overall process, but fail to be able to imagine or ‘encapsulate’ the process as an ‘object’.Widening the perspective to link symbolism to embodiment reveals that symbolic compression from procedure to process to object has an embodied counterpart. This happens when the actions involved operate on visible objects. The actions have an effect on the objects, for instance, when sharing them into equal shares, permuting them into a new arrangement, or translating an object on a plane. The ‘effect’ is the change from the initial state to the final state. The compression from procedure to process can be seen by shifting the focus of attention from the steps of a procedure to the effect of the procedure.\" (Tall, The Transition to Formal Thinking in Mathematics)",

      "text": "\"The concept of real number is a blend of embodiment as a number line, symbolism as (infinite) decimals and formalism as a complete ordered field. Each has its own properties, some of which are in conflict. For instance, the number line develops in the embodied world from a physical line drawn with pencil and ruler to a ‘perfect’ platonic construction that has length but no thickness. This is a natural process of compression in which the focus of attention concentrates on the straightness of the line and the position of the lines and points. In Greek geometry, points and lines are different kinds of entity in which a point has position but no size and a point may by ‘on’ a line or not. The line is an entity in itself; it is not ‘made up of points’.Physically the number line can be traced with a finger and, as the finger passes from 1 to 2, it feels as if it goes through all the points in between. But when this is represented as decimals, each decimal expansion is a different point (except for the difficult case of recurring nines) and so it does not seem possible to imagine running through all the points between 1 and 2 in a finite time. There is also the counterfactual dilemma that, if the points have no size, how can even an infinite number of them make up the unit interval? In the embodied world we may imagine a point as a very tiny mark made with a fine pencil, so practical points have an indeterminate small size even if theoretical points do not. Furthermore, if a point had no size and a line no thickness, then we would not be able to see them. Prior to the introduction of the formal definition of real numbers, we live, perhaps somewhat uneasily, with the blend of a practical number line that we draw and imagine and a symbolic number system that can be represented by infinite decimals.Formally, the real numbers  is an ordered field satisfying the completeness axiom. This involves entering a completely different world where addition is no longer defined by the algorithms of counting or decimal addition, instead it is simply asserted that for each pair of real numbers a, b, there is a third real number call the sum of a and b and denoted by a+b. Formally, it is possible to prove that there is, up to isomorphism, precisely one complete ordered field and that this can be represented by infinite decimals which are unique (except for the case where one decimal ends in an infinite sequence of nines and the other increases the previous place by one and ends in an infinite sequence of zeros). Thus it is possible for the human brain to recycle its former experiences and use the arithmetic of experience to blend the symbolic world with the formal world.Personally I continue to be concerned that I ‘know’ things symbolically that I have never proved axiomatically. In the symbolic world, I ‘know’ that 210 is bigger than 103, because the first is 1024 and the second is 1000. But I have never proved this from the axioms for a complete ordered field or from the Peano postulates for the whole numbers. I am happy to accept that the familiar arithmetic of decimals is the unique arithmetic of the axiomatic complete ordered field because it fits together so coherently. But ‘acceptance’ is not mathematical proof.In the transition from school arithmetic to formal mathematics we need to confront many issues such as this. Is it any wonder that Halmos in his book I want to be a mathematician remarked, ‘I never understood epsilon-delta analysis, I just got used to it.’ As mathematicians we begin to appreciate the purity and logic of the formal approach, but as human beings we should recognise the cognitive journey through embodiment and symbolism that enabled us to reach this viewpoint and helps us sustain it.\" (Tall, The Transition to Formal Thinking in Mathematics)",

But the first work to refer explicitly to the sine as a function of an angle is the Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata (ca. 510), considered the earliest Hindu treatise on pure mathematics.1 In this work Aryabhata (also known as Aryabhata the elder; born 475 or 476, died ca. 550)2 uses the word ardha-jya for the half- chord, which he sometimes turns around to jya-ardha (“chord- half”); in due time he shortens it to jya or jiva.Now begins an interesting etymological evolution that would finally lead to our modern word “sine.” When the Arabs trans- lated the Aryabhatiya into their own language, they retained the word jiva without translating its meaning. In Arabic—as also in Hebrew—words consist mostly of consonants, the pronunciation of the missing vowels being understood through common usage. Thus jiva could also be pronounced as jiba or jaib, and jaib in Arabic means bosom, fold, or bay. When the Arabic version was translated into Latin, jaib was translated into sinus, which means bosom, bay, or curve (on lunar maps regions resembling bays are still described as sinus). We find the word sinus in the writings of Gherardo of Cremona (ca. 1114–1187), who translated many of the old Greek works, including the Almagest, from Arabic into Latin. Other writers followed, and soon the word sinus—or sine in its English version—became common in mathematical texts throughout Europe. The abbreviated notation sin was first used by Edmund Gunter (1581–1626), an English minister who later became professor of astronomy at Gresham College in London. In 1624 he invented a mechanical device, the “Gunter scale,” for computing with logarithms—a forerunner of the familiar slide rule—and the notation sin (as well as tan) first appeared in a drawing describing his invention.3\" (Maor, Trigonometric Delights) <Origins>",

The word “cotangens” [sic] was first used by Edmund Gunter in 1620. Var- ious abbreviations were suggested for these functions, among them t and t co by William Oughtred (1657) and T and t by John Wallis (1693). But the first to use such abbreviations con- sistently was Richard Norwood (1590–1665), an English mathe- matician and surveyor; in a work on trigonometry published in London in 1631 he wrote: “In these examples s stands for sine: t for tangent: sc for sine complement [i.e., cosine]: tc for tangent complement: sec for secant.” We note that even today there is no universal conformity of notation, and European texts often use “tg” and “ctg” for tangent and cotangent.The word “tangent” comes from the Latin tangere, to touch; its association with the tangent function may have come from the following observation: in a circle with center at O and radius r (fig. 16), let AB be the chord subtended by the central angle 2α, and OQ the bisector of this angle. Draw a line parallel to AB and tangent to the circle at Q, and extend OA and OB until they meet this line at C and D, respectively. We haveAB = 2r sin α, CD = 2r tan α. showing that the tangent function is related to the tangent line in the same way as the sine function is to the chord.

But it was his pupil Johann Mu ̈ller (1436–1476), known as Regiomon- tanus (because he was born in Ko ̈nigsberg, which in German means “the royal mountain”) who wrote the first comprehen- sive treatise on trigonometry up to date. In his De triangulis omnimodis libri quinque (“of triangles of every kind in five books,” ca. 1464)6 he developed the subject starting from ba- sic geometric concepts and leading to the definition of the sine function; he then showed how to solve any triangle—plane or spherical—using either the sine of an angle or the sine of its complement (the cosine). The Law of Sines is stated here in verbal form, and so is the rule for finding the area of a trian- gle, A = ab sin γ/2. Curiously the tangent function is absent, possibly because the main thrust of the work was spherical trigonometry where the sine function is dominant.De triangulis was the most influential work on trigonometry of its time; a copy of it reached Copernicus, who studied it thoroughly (see p. 45). However, another century would pass before the word “trigonometry” appeared in a title of a book. This honor goes to Bartholom ̈aus Pitiscus (1561–1613), a Ger- man clergyman whose main interest was mathematics. His book, Trigonometriae sive de dimensione triangulorum libri quinque (On trigonometry, or, concerning the properties of triangles, in five books), appeared in Frankfort in 1595.

A thing a is the same as b (identical with b), and b the same as a, when all that can be thought concerning a can also be thought concernting b, and when all that is true of b can also be thought of a.The explanation of how symbols denote things is just fine; what I object to is his concept of things being objects of our thought.

There’s a fair amount of philosophy that’s of interest for historical reasons, so I’ll quote the first half of the paragraph and a footnote as translated by Beman.It very frequently happens that different things, a,b,c,... for some reason can be considered from a common point of view, can be associated in the mind, and we say that they form a system S; we call the things a,b,c... elements of the system S, they are contained in S; conversely, S consists of these elements. Such a system S (an aggregate, a manifold, a totality) as an object of our thought is likewise a thing [1]; it is completely determined when with respect to every thing it is determined whether it is an element of S or not.This point is footnoted.In what manner this determination is brought about, and whether we know a way of deciding upon it, is a matter of indifference for all that follows; the general laws to be developed in no way depend upon it; they hold under all circumstances. I mention this expressly because Kronecker not long ago (Crelle’s Journal, Vol. 99, pp. 334–336) has endeavored to impose certain limitations upon the free formation of concepts in mathematics which I do not believe to be justified; but there seems to be no call to enter upon this matter with more detail until the distinguished mathematician shall have published his reasons for the necessity or merely the expediency of these limitations.Note that Dedekind says a set is a thing, which allows for a set of sets. Also, with the understanding that a set is determined by its elements, he declares that two sets are equal, S = T , when they have exactly the same elements.He mentions that the set S that contains only one element a should not be considered to be the same as the thing a itself. We would say the singleton set {a} is not the same as a. Even though Dedekind uses the same notation for a as for {a}—indeed he never uses curly braces for sets—I’ll make the distinction in these notes.\" (Joyce, Notes on Richard Dedekind’s Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?) <Origins> <Justif>",

      "text": "Note that since we now reached Dedekind Cuts in Zakon, we can finally better notice the subtlety that Russell is talking about (not that we find it any better in Schizophrenic mode). The difference in construction also reminds us of Bishop. Also note that in Zakon's book the original 'postulation' variant is used, it dates from 1888, while Russell's paper dates from 1919.\"From the habit of being influenced by spatial imagination, people have supposed that series must have limits in cases where it seems odd if they do not. Thus, perceiving that there was no rational limit to the ratios whose square is less than 2, they allowed themselves to “postulate” an irrational limit, which was to fill the Dedekind gap. Dedekind, in the above-mentioned work, set up the axiom that the gap must always be filled, i.e. that every section must have a boundary. It is for this reason that series where his axiom is verified are called“Dedekindian.” But there are an infinite number of series for which it is not verified.The method of “postulating” what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil. Let us leave them to others and proceed with our honest toil.It is clear that an irrational Dedekind cut in some way “represents”an irrational. In order to make use of this, which to begin with is no more than a vague feeling, we must find some way of eliciting fromit a precise definition; and in order to do this, we must disabuse our minds of the notion that an irrational must be the limit of a set of ratios. Just as ratios whose denominator is 1 are not identical with integers, so those rational | numbers which can be greater or less 72 than irrationals, or can have irrationals as their limits, must not be identified with ratios. We have to define a new kind of numbers called“real numbers,” of which some will be rational and some irrational. Those that are rational “correspond” to ratios, in the same kind of way in which the ratio n/1 corresponds to the integer n; but they are not the same as ratios. In order to decide what they are to be, let us observe that an irrational is represented by an irrational cut, and a cut is represented by its lower section. Let us confine ourselves to cuts in which the lower section has no maximum; in this case we will call the lower section a “segment.” Then those segments that correspond to ratios are those that consist of all ratios less than the ratio they correspond to, which is their boundary; while those that represent irrationals are those that have no boundary. Segments, both those that have boundaries and those that do not, are such that, of any two pertaining to one series, one must be part of the other; hence they can all be arranged in a series by the relation of whole and part. A series in which there are Dedekind gaps, i.e. in which there are segments that have no boundary, will give rise to more segments than it has terms, since each term will define a segment having that term for boundary, and then the segments without boundaries will be extra.We are now in a position to define a real number and an irrational number.A “real number” is a segment of the series of ratios in order of magnitude.An “irrational number” is a segment of the series of ratios which has no boundary.A “rational real number” is a segment of the series of ratios which has a boundary....The above definition of real numbers is an example of “construc- tion” as against “postulation,” of which we had another example in the definition of cardinal numbers. The great advantage of this method is that it requires no new assumptions, but enables us to proceed deductively from the original apparatus of logic.\" (Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy) <Origins>",

Each of these two men gave a precise significance to the term, but Cantor’sdefinition is narrower than Dedekind’s: a series which has Cantorian continuity must have Dedekindian continuity, but the converse does not hold.The first definition that would naturally occur to a man seekinga precise meaning for the continuity of series would be to define itas consisting in what we have called “compactness,” i.e. in the factthat between any two terms of the series there are others. But this would be an inadequate definition, because of the existence of “gaps”in series such as the series of ratios. We saw in Chapter VII. that thereare innumerable ways in which the series of ratios can be dividedinto two parts, of which one wholly precedes the other, and of which thefirsthasnolastterm,|whilethesecondhasnofirstterm.Such a state of a↵airs seems contrary to the vague feelingwe have as to what should characterise “continuity,” and, what is more, it shows that the series of ratios is not the sort of series that is needed for many mathematical purposes. Take geometry, for example: we wish to be able to say that when two straight lines cross each other they have a point in common, but if the series of points on a line were similar to the series of ratios, the two lines might cross in a “gap” and have no point in common. This is a crude example, but many others might be given to show that compactness is inadequate as a mathematical definition of continuity.It was the needs of geometry, as much as anything, that led to the definition of “Dedekindian” continuity. It will be remembered that we defined a series as Dedekindian when every sub-class of the field has a boundary. (It is sucient to assume that there is always an upper boundary, or that there is always a lower boundary. If one of these is assumed, the other can be deduced.) That is to say, a series is Dedekindian when there are no gaps. The absence of gaps may arise either through terms having successors, or through the existence of limits in the absence of maxima. Thus a finite series or a well-ordered series is Dedekindian, and so is the series of real numbers. The former sort of Dedekindian series is excluded by assuming that our series is compact; in that case our series must have a property which may, for many purposes, be fittingly called continuity. Thus we are led to the definition:A series has “Dedekindian continuity” when it is Dedekindian and compact.But this definition is stilltoo wide for many purposes. Suppose,for example, that we desire to be able to assign such properties to geometrical space as shall make it certain that every point can be specified by means of co-ordinates which are real numbers: this is not insured by Dedekindian continuity alone. We want to be sure that every point which cannot be specified by rational co-ordinates can be specifiedasthelimitofaprogressionofpoints|whoseco-ordinates are rational, and this is a further property which our definition doesnot enable us to deduce.We are thus led to a closer investigation of series with respect to limits. This investigation was made by Cantor and formed the basis of his definition of continuity, although, in its simplest form, this definition somewhat conceals the considerations which have given rise to it. We shall, therefore, first travel through some of Cantor’s conceptions in this subject before giving his definition of continuity.Cantor defines aseries as “perfect” when all its points are limiting- points and all its limiting-points belong to it. But this definition does not express quite accurately what he means. There is no correction required so far as concerns the property that all its points are to be limiting-points; this is a property belonging to compact series, and to no others if all points are to be upper limiting- or all lower limiting- points. But if it is only assumed that they are limiting-points one way, without specifying which, there will be other series that will have the property in question—for example, the series of decimals in which a decimal ending in a recurring 9 is distinguished from the corresponding terminating decimal and placed immediately before it. Such a series is very nearly compact, but has exceptional terms which are consecutive, and of which the first has no immediate predecessor, while the second has no immediate successor. Apart from such series, the series in which every point is a limiting-point are compact series; and this holds without qualification if it is specified that every point is to be an upper limiting-point (or that every point is to be a lower limiting-point).Although Cantor does not explicitly consider the matter, we must distinguish di↵erent kinds of limiting-points according to the nature of the smallest sub-series by which they can be defined. Cantor assumes that they are to be defined by progressions, or by regressions (which are the converses of progressions). When every member of our series is the limit of a progression or regression, Cantor calls our series “condensed in itself” (insichdicht). |Wecomenowtothesecondpropertybywhichperfectionwasto 103 be defined, namely, the property which Cantor calls that of being “closed” (abgeschlossen). This, as we saw, was first defined as consistingin the fact that all the limiting-points of a series belong to it. But this only has any e↵ective significance if our series is given as containedin some other larger series (as is the case, e.g., with a selection ofreal numbers), and limiting-points are taken in relation to the largerseries. Otherwise, if a series is considered simply on its own account, it cannot fail to contain its limiting-points. What Cantor means is not exactly what he says; indeed, on other occasions he says something rather di↵erent, which is what he means. What he really means isthat every subordinate series which is of the sort that might be expected to have a limit does have a limit within the given series; i.e. every subordinate series which has no maximum has a limit, i.e. every subordinate series has a boundary. But Cantor does not state this for every subordinate series, but only for progressions and regressions. (It is not clear how far he recognises that this is a limitation.) Thus, finally, we find that the definition we want is the following:—A series is said to be “closed” (abgeschlossen) when every progres- sion or regression contained in the series has a limit in the series.We then have the further definition:—A series is “perfect” when it is condensed in itself and closed, i.e. when every term is the limit of a progression or regression, and every progression or regression contained in the series has a limit in the series.In seeking a definition of continuity, what Cantor has in mindis the search for a definition which shall apply to the series of real numbers and to any series similar to that, but to no others. Forthis purpose we have to add a further property. Among the real numbers some are rational, some are irrational; although the numberof irrationals is greater than the number of rationals, yet there are rationals between any two real numbers, however | little the two may 104 di↵er. The number of rationals, as we saw, is @0. This gives a further property which suces tocharacterise continuity completely, namely,the property of containing a class of @0 members in such a way that some of this class occur between any two terms of our series, however near together. This property, added to perfection, suces to definea class of series which are all similar and are in fact a serial number. This class Cantor defines as that of continuous series.We may slightly simplify his definition. To begin with, we say:A “median class” of a series is a sub-class of the field such that members of it are to be found between any two terms of the series.Thus the rationals are a median class in the series of real numbers. It is obvious that there cannot be median classes except in compact series.We then find that Cantor’s definition is equivalent to the follow- ing:—A series is“continuous” when (1) it is Dedekindian, (2) it contains a median class having @0 terms.To avoid confusion, we shall speak of this kind as “Cantorian continuity.” It will be seen that it implies Dedekindian continuity, but the converse is not the case. All series having Cantorian continuity are similar, but not all series having Dedekindian continuity.The notions of limit and continuity which we have been defining must not be confounded with the notions of the limit of a function for approaches to a given argument, or the continuity of a function in the neighbourhood of a given argument. These are di↵erent notions, very important, but derivative from the above and more complicated. The continuity of motion (if motion is continuous) is an instance of the continuity of a function; on the other hand, the continuity of spaceand time (if they are continuous) is an instance of the continuity of series, or (to speak more cautiously) of a kind of continuity whichcan, by sucient mathematical | manipulation, be reduced to the 105 continuity of series. In view of the fundamental importance of motionin applied mathematics, as well as for other reasons, it will be wellto deal briefly with the notions of limits and continuity as appliedto functions; but this subject will be best reserved for a separate chapter.The definitions of continuity which we have been considering, namely, those of Dedekind and Cantor, do not correspond very closely to the vague idea which is associated with the word in the mind of the man in the street or the philosopher. They conceive continuity rather as absence of separateness, the sort of general obliteration of distinctions which characterises a thick fog. A fog gives an impression of vastness without definite multiplicity or division. It is this sort of thing that a metaphysician means by “continuity,” declaring it, very truly, to be characteristic of his mental life and of that of children and animals.The general idea vaguely indicated by the word “continuity” whenso employed, or by the word “flux,” is one which is certainly quite di↵erent from that which we have been defining. Take, for example,the series of real numbers. Each is what it is, quite definitely and uncompromisingly; it does not pass over by imperceptible degreesinto another; it is a hard, separate unit, and its distance from every other unit is finite, though it can be made less than any given finite amount assigned in advance. The question of the relation betweenthe kind of continuity existing among the real numbers and the kind exhibited, e.g. by what we see at a given time, is a dicultand intricate one. It is not to be maintained that the two kinds are simply identical, but it may, I think, be very well maintained thatthe mathematical conception which we have been considering in this chapter gives the abstract logical scheme to which it mustbe possibleto bring empirical material by suitable manipulation, if that materialis to be called “continuous” in any precisely definable sense. It wouldbe quite impossible | to justify this thesis within the limits of the 106 present volume. The reader who is interested may read an attemptto justify it as regards timein particular by the present author inthe Monist for 19145, as well as in parts of Our Knowledge of the External World. With these indications, we must leave this problem, interesting as it is, in order to return to topics more closely connected with mathematics.\" (Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy)",

Buta few further points should be noted. If “idea” is to be understood logically, it may be identical with the object, or it may stand for a description (in the sense to be explained in a subsequent chapter). Inthe former case the argument fails, because it was essential to the proof of reflexiveness that object and idea should be distinct. In the second case the argument also fails, because the relation of objectand description is not | one-one: there are innumerable correct de- 140 scriptions of any given object. Socrates (e.g.) may be described as“the master of Plato,” or as “the philosopher who drank the hem- lock,” or as “the husband of Xantippe.” If—to take up the remaining hypothesis—“idea” is to be interpreted psychologically, it must be maintained that there is not any one definite psychological entity which could be called the idea of the object: there are innumerable beliefs and attitudes, each of which could be called an idea of the object in the sense in which we might say “my idea of Socrates is quite di↵erent from yours,” but there is not any central entity (ex- cept Socrates himself) to bind together various “ideas of Socrates,” and thus there is not any such one-one relation of idea and object as the argument supposes. Nor, of course, as we have already noted, is it true psychologically that there are ideas (in however extended a sense) of more than a tiny proportion of the things in the world. For all these reasons, the above argument in favour of the logical existence of reflexive classes must be rejected.\" (Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy)",

As we have seen, there are reasons to think that by 1900 or even 1910 Hilbert identified the set-theoretical approach also with Dedekind. But it is not by chance that he later preferred to mention Cantor, since Dedekind's approach, in its concentration upon systematics and foundations, must have seemed somewhat one-sided to Hilbert. Characteristically, he decided to associate the name of set theory with the man who posed completely new questions in this area, opening up a pure, abstract paradise.

The person who first discovered the irrationality of √2, that person was one of the world’s first illogicians. Sadly all the mischief has been stripped from his legacy: the result is now regarded with utmost gravity, and not considered to be mischievous at all.A number of open questions in mathematics are irrationality questions about certain specific numbers. Is e+pi rational or irrational? It’s known that e and pi are both irrational by themselves, but nobody knows whether e+pi is irrational. It’s generally thought to be irrational but nobody can prove it. Maybe part of the reason why these questions are open is because mathematicians take them too seriously. Existing irrationality proofs, from √2 to pi, are inherently mischievous and naughty. The only reason they don’t seem that way is because age has granted them a solemn seriousness.In time, Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems and Hilbert’s Tenth Problem will be routinely taught in high school. And it breaks my heart to say it, but I suppose it will be drained of all the mischief and all the playfulness, and will be drilled into those future high school students with crushing gravity and seriousness.

      "text": "\"Is Mathematics Quasi-Empirical?[First a caveat. I'm about to discuss what I think is the significance of incompleteness. But it's possible to argue that the incompleteness theorems completely miss the point because mathematics isn't about the consequences of rules, it's about creativity and imagination. Consider the imaginary number i, the square root of minus one. This number was impossible, it broke the rule that x2 must be positive, but mathematics eventually benefited and made more sense with i than without i. So maybe the incompleteness theorems are irrelevant! Because they limit formal reasoning, but they say nothing about what happens when we change the rules of the game. As a creative mathematician I certainly sympathize with the point of view that the imagination to change the rules of the game is more important than grinding out the consequences of a given set of rules. But I don't know how to analyze creativity and imagination with my metamathematical tools... For the history of i, see T. Dantzig, Number—The Language of Science, and P.J. Nahin, An Imaginary Tale—The Story of the Square Root of −1.]What I think it all means is that mathematics is different from physics, but it's not that different. I think that math is quasi-empirical. It's different from physics, but it's more a matter of degree than an all or nothing difference. I don't think that mathematicians have a direct pipeline to God's thoughts, to absolute truth, while physics must always remain tentative and subject to revision. Yes, math is less tentative than physics, but they're both in the same boat, because they're both human activities, and to err is human.Now physicists used to love it when I said this, and mathematicians either hated it and said I was crazy or pretended not to understand.But a funny thing has happened. I'm not alone anymore.Now there's a journal called Experimental Mathematics. At Simon Fraser University in Canada there's a Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics. And Thomas Tymoczko has published an anthology called New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics with essays by philosophers, mathematicians and computer scientists that he says support a quasi-empirical view of math. I'm happy to say that two of my articles are in his book.By the way, the name ``quasi-empirical'' seems to come from Imre Lakatos. He uses it in an essay in Tymoczko's anthology. I used to say that ``perhaps mathematics should be pursued somewhat more in the spirit of an experimental science,'' which is a mouthful. It's much better to say ``maybe math is quasi-empirical!''And I've seen computer scientists do some things quasi-empirically. They've added P ≠ NP as a new axiom. Everyone believes that P ≠ NP based on experimental evidence, but no one can prove it. And theoreticians working on cryptography assume that certain problems are hard, even though no one can prove it. Why? Simply because no one has been able to find an easy way to solve these problems, and no one has been able to break encryption schemes that are based on these problems.The computer has expanded mathematical experience so greatly, that in order to cope, mathematicians are behaving differently. They're using unproved hypotheses that seem to be true.So maybe Gödel was right after all, maybe incompleteness is a serious business. Maybe the traditional view that math gives absolute certainty is false.Enough talking! Let's do some computer programming!

He developed the idea first in 1858 though he did not publish it until 1872. This is what he wrote at the beginning of the article. As professor in the Polytechnic School in Zürich I found myself for the first time obliged to lecture upon the ideas of the differential calculus and felt more keenly than ever before the lack of a really scientific foundation for arithmetic. In discussing the notion of the approach of a variable magnitude to a fixed limiting value, and especially in proving the theorem that every magnitude which grows continuously but not beyond all limits, must certainly approach a limiting value, I had recourse to geometric evidences. ... This feeling of dissatisfaction was so overpowering that I made the fixed resolve to keep mediating on the question till I should find a purely arithmetic and perfectly rigorous foundation for the principles of infinitesimal analysis. He defined a real number to be a pair (L, R) of sets of rationals which have the following properties. Every rational is in exactly one of the sets Every rational in L is < every rational in RSuch a pair is called a Dedekind cut (Schnitt in German). You can think of it as defining a real number which is the least upper bound of the \"Left-hand set\" L and also the greatest lower bound of the \"right-hand set\" R. If the cut defines a rational number then this may be in either of the two sets.It is rather a rather long (and tedious) task to define the arithmetic operations and order relation on such cuts and to verify that they do then satisfy the axioms for the Reals -- including even the Completeness Axiom.Richard Dedekind, along with Bernhard Riemann was the last research student of Gauss. His arithmetisation of analysis was his most important contribution to mathematics, but was not enthusiastically received by leading mathematicians of his day, notably Kronecker and Weierstrass. His ideas were, however, warmly welcomed by Jordan and especially by Cantor with whom he became firm friends. \" (http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~john/analysis/Lectures/A3.html) <Origins>Note: The paper I am partially reading was published later: 1888 \"Richard Dedekind (1831–1916) published in 1888 a paper entitled Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? variously translated as What are numbers and what should they be? or, as Beman did, The Nature of Meaning of Numbers.\"",

      "text": "\" By the time Stevin proposed the use of decimal fractions in 1585, the concept of a number had developed little from that of Euclid's Elements. Details of the earlier contributions are examined in some detail in our article: The real numbers: Pythagoras to StevinIf we move forward almost exactly 100 years to the publication of A treatise of Algebra by Wallis in 1684 we find that he accepts, without any great enthusiasm, the use of Stevin's decimals. He still only considers finite decimal expansions and realises that with these one can approximate numbers (which for him are constructed from positive integers by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking nth roots) as closely as one wishes. However, Wallis understood that there were proportions which did not fall within this definition of number, such as those associated with the area and circumference of a circle:- ... such proportion is not to be expressed in the commonly received ways of notation: particularly that for the circles quadrature. ... Now, as for other incommensurable quantities, though this proportion cannot be accurately expressed in absolute numbers, yet by continued approximation it may; so as to approach nearer to it than any difference assignable. For Wallis there were a variety of ways that one might achieve this approximation, so coming as close as one pleased. He considered approximations by continued fractions, and also approximations by taking successive square roots. This leads into the study of infinite series but without the necessary machinery to prove that these infinite series converged to a limit, he was never going to be able to progress much further in studying real numbers. Real numbers became very much associated with magnitudes. No definition was really thought necessary, and in fact the mathematics was considered the science of magnitudes. Euler, in Complete introduction to algebra (1771) wrote in the introduction:- Mathematics, in general, is the science of quantity; or, the science which investigates the means of measuring quantity. He also defined the notion of quantity as that which can be continuously increased or diminished and thought of length, area, volume, mass, velocity, time, etc. to be different examples of quantity. All could be measured by real numbers. However, Euler's mathematics itself led to a more abstract idea of quantity, a variable x which need not necessarily take real values. Symbolic mathematics took the notion of quantity too far, and a reassessment of the concept of a real number became more necessary. By the beginning of the nineteenth century a more rigorous approach to mathematics, principally by Cauchy and Bolzano, began to provide the machinery to put the real numbers on a firmer footing. Grabiner writes [2]:- ... though Cauchy implicitly assumed several forms of the completeness axiom for the real numbers, he did not fully understand the nature of completeness or the related topological properties of sets of real numbers or of points in space. ... Cauchy did not have explicit formulations for the completeness of the real numbers. Among the forms of the completeness property he implicitly assumed are that a bounded monotone sequence converges to a limit and that the Cauchy criterion is a sufficient condition for the convergence of a series. Though Cauchy understood that a real number could be obtained as the limit of rationals, he did not develop his insight into a definition of real numbers or a detailed description of the properties of real numbers. Cauchy, in Cours d'analyse (1821), did not worry too much about the definition of the real numbers. He does say that a real number is the limit of a sequence of rational numbers but he is assuming here that the real numbers are known. Certainly this is not considered by Cauchy to be a definition of a real number, rather it is simply a statement of what he considers an \"obvious\" property. He says nothing about the need for the sequence to be what we call today a Cauchy sequence and this is necessary if one is to define convergence of a sequence without assuming the existence of its limit. He does define the product of a rational number A and an irrational number B as follows:- Let b, b', b'', ... be a sequence of rationals approaching B closer and closer. Then the product AB will be the limit of the sequence of rational numbers Ab, Ab', Ab'', ... Bolzano, on the other hand, showed that bounded Cauchy sequence of real numbers had a least upper bound in 1817. He later worked out his own theory of real numbers which he did not publish. This was a quite remarkable achievement and it is only comparatively recently that we have understood exactly what he did achieve. His definition of a real number was made in terms of convergent sequences of rational numbers and is explained in [22] where Rychlik describes it as \"not quite correct\". In [28] van Rootselaar disagrees saying that \"Bolzano's elaboration is quite incorrect\". However in J Berg's edition of Bolzano's Reine Zahlenlehre which was published in 1976, Berg points out that Bolzano had discovered the difficulties himself and Berg found notes by Bolzano which proposed amendments to his theory which make it completely correct. As Bolzano's contributions were unpublished they had little influence in the development of the theory of the real numbers.Cauchy himself does not seem to have understood the significance of his own \"Cauchy sequence\" criterion for defining the real numbers. Nor did his immediate successors. It was Weierstrass, Heine, Méray, Cantor and Dedekind who, after convergence and uniform convergence were better understood, were able to give rigorous definitions of the real numbers.Up to this time there was no proof that numbers existed that were not the roots of polynomial equations with rational coefficients. Clearly √2 is the root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients, namely x2 = 2, and it is easy to see that all roots of rational numbers arise as solutions of such equations. A number is called transcendental if it is not the root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients. The word transcendental is used as such number transcend the usual operations of arithmetic. Although mathematicians had guessed for a long time that π and e were transcendental, this had not been proved up to the middle of the 19th century. Liouville's interest in transcendental numbers stemmed from reading a correspondence between Goldbach and Daniel Bernoulli. Liouville certainly aimed to prove that e is transcendental but he did not succeed. However his contributions led him to prove the existence of a transcendental number in 1844 when he constructed an infinite class of such numbers using continued fractions. These were the first numbers to be proved transcendental. In 1851 he published results on transcendental numbers removing the dependence on continued fractions. In particular he gave an example of a transcendental number, the number now named the Liouvillian number 0.1100010000000000000000010000... where there is a 1 in place n! and 0 elsewhere.One of the first people to attempt to give a rigorous definition of the real numbers was Hamilton. Perhaps, if one thinks about it, it is logical that he would be interested in this since his introduction of the quaternions had shown that there were new previously unstudied number systems. In fact came close to the idea of a Dedekind cut, as Euclid had done in the Elements, but failed to make the idea into a definition (again Euclid had spotted the property but never thought to use it as a definition). For a number a he noted that there are rationals a', a\", b', b\", c', c\", d', d\", ... with a' < a < a\" b' < a < b\" c' < a < c\" d' < a < d\" ... but he never thought to define a number by the sets {a', b', c', d', ... } and {a\", b\", c\", d\", ... }. He tried another approach of defining numbers given by some law, say x goesto x2. Hamilton writes:- If x undergoes a continuous and constant increase from zero, then will pass successively through every state of positive ration b, and therefore that every determined positive ration b has one determined square root √b which will be commensurable or incommensurable according as b can or cannot be expressed as the square of a fraction. When b cannot be so expressed, it is still possible to approximate in fractions to the incommensurable square root √b by choosing successively larger and larger positive denominators ... One can see what Hamilton is getting at, but much here is without justification - can a quantity undergo a continuous and constant increase. Even if one got round this problem he is only defining numbers given by a law. It is unclear whether he thought that all real numbers would arise in this way.When progress came in giving a rigorous definition of a real number, there was a sudden flood of contributions. Dedekind worked out his theory of Dedekind cuts in 1858 but it remained unpublished until 1872. Weierstrass gave his own theory of real numbers in his Berlin lectures beginning in 1865 but this work was not published. The first published contribution regarding this new approach came in 1867 from Hankel who was a student of Weierstrass. Hankel, for the first time, suggests a total change in out point of view regarding the concept of a real number:- Today number is no longer an object, a substance which exists outside the thinking subject and the objects giving rise to this substance, an independent principle, as it was for instance for the Pythagoreans. Therefore, the question of the existence of numbers can only refer to the thinking subject or to those objects of thought whose relations are represented by numbers. Strictly speaking, only that which is logically impossible (i.e. which contradicts itself) counts as impossible for the mathematician. In his 1867 monograph Hankel addressed the question of whether there were other \"number systems\" which had essentially the same rules as the real numbers.Two years after the publication of Hankel's monograph, Méray published Remarques sur la nature des quantités in which he considered Cauchy sequences of rational numbers which, if they did not converge to a rational limit, had what he called a \"fictitious limit\". He then considered the real numbers to consist of the rational numbers and his fictitious limits. Three years later Heine published a similar notion in his book Elemente der Functionenlehre although it was done independently of Méray. It was similar in nature with the ideas which Weierstrass had discussed in his lectures. Heine's system has become one of the two standard ways of defining the real numbers today. Essentially Heine looks at Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. He defines an equivalence relation on such sequences by defining a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , ... and b1, b2 , b3 , b4 , ... to be equivalent if the sequence of rational numbers a1 - b1, a2 - b2 , a3 - b3 , a4 - b4 , ... converges to 0. Heine then introduced arithmetic operations on his sequences and an order relation. Particular care is needed to handle division since sequences with a non-zero limit might still have terms equal to 0.Cantor also published his version of the real numbers in 1872 which followed a similar method to that of Heine. His numbers were Cauchy sequences of rational numbers and he used the term \"determinate limit\". It was clear to Hankel (see the quote above) that the new ideas of number had suddenly totally changed a concept which had been motivated by measurement and quantity. Similarly Cantor realised that if he wants the line to represent the real numbers then he has to introduce an axiom to recover the connection between the way the real numbers are now being defined and the old concept of measurement. He writes about a distance of a point from the origin on the line:- If this distance has a rational relation to the unit of measure, then it is expressed by a rational quantity in the domain of rational numbers; otherwise, if the point is one known through a construction, it is always possible to give a sequence of rationals a1 , a2 , a3 , ..., an , ... which has the properties indicated and relates to the distance in question in such a way that the points on the straight line to which the distances a1 , a2 , a3 , ..., an , ... are assigned approach in infinity the point to be determined with increasing n. ... In order to complete the connection presented in this section of the domains of the quantities defined [his determinate limits] with the geometry of the straight line, one must add an axiom which simple says that every numerical quantity also has a determined point on the straight line whose coordinate is equal to that quantity, indeed, equal in the sense in which this is explained in this section. As we mentioned above, Dedekind had worked out his idea of Dedekind cuts in 1858. When he realised that others like Heine and Cantor were about to publish their versions of a rigorous definition of the real numbers he decided that he too should publish his ideas. This resulted in yet another 1872 publication giving a definition of the real numbers. Dedekind considered all decompositions of the rational numbers into two sets A1 , A2 so that a1 < a2 for all a1 in A1 and a2 in A2. He called (A1, A2) a cut. If the rational a is either the maximum element of A1 or the minimum element of A2 then Dedekind said the cut was produced by a. However not all cuts were produced by a rational. He wrote:- In every case in which a cut (A1, A2) is given that is not produced by a rational number, we create a new number, an irrational number a, which we consider to be completely defined by this cut; we will say that the number a corresponds to this cut or that it produces the cut. He defined the usual arithmetic operations and ordering and showed that the usual laws apply.Another definition, similar in style to that of Heine and Cantor, appeared in a book by Thomae in 1880. Thomae had been a colleague of Heine and Cantor around the time they had been writing up their ideas. He claimed that the real numbers defined in this way had a right to exist because:- ... the rules of combination abstracted from calculations with integers may be applied to them without contradiction. Frege, however, attacked these ideas of Thomae. He wanted to develop a theory of real numbers based on a purely logical base and attacked the philosophy behind the constructions which had been published. Thomae added further explanation to his idea of \"formal arithmetic\" in the second edition of his text which appeared in 1898:- The formal conception of numbers requires of itself more modest limitations than does the logical conception. It does not ask, what are and what shall the numbers be, but it asks, what does one require of numbers in arithmetic. Frege was still unhappy with the constructions of Weierstrass, Heine, Cantor, Thomae and Dedekind. How did one know. he asked, that the constructions led to systems which would not produced contradictions? He wrote in 1903:- This task has never been approached seriously, let alone been solved. Frege, however, never completed his own version of a logical framework. His hopes were shattered when he learnt of Russell's paradox. Hilbert had taken a totally different approach to defining the real numbers in 1900. He defined the real numbers to be a system with eighteen axioms. Sixteen of these axioms define what today we call an ordered field, while the other two were the Archimedean axiom and the completeness axiom. The Archimedean axiom stated that given positive numbers a and b then it is possible to add a to itself a finite number of times so that the sum exceed b. The completeness property says that one cannot extend the system and maintain the validity of all the other axioms. This was totally new since all other methods built the real numbers from the known rational numbers. Hilbert's numbers were unconnected with any known system. It was impossible to say whether a given mathematical object was a real number. Most seriously, there was no proof that any such system actually existed. If it did it was still subject to the same questions concerning its consistency as Frege had pointed out.By the beginning of the 20th century, then, the concept of a real number had moved away completely from the concept of a number which had existed from the most ancient times to the beginning of the 19th century, namely its connection with measurement and quantity. \"",
