## The Search for Fundamental Reasons

Studying, in particular studying math, in particular studying math without constraints guided by my own questions, has been the most rewarding and the most frustrating activity, simultaneously.

_Scribblings from my mathematical explorations_

Below is a series of screenshots from 2016, from my [TheNotes](https://github.com/jadnohra/TheNotes?tab=readme-ov-file#thenotes) collection in which I hopelessly try to cram linear notation into a graphical proof notation, that tries to be consistent and as powerful as first order logic, but much more dense, carrying a lot of information by being 2 dimensional (graphical) and not purely textual.

I failed miserably, but the scribblings evoke very good feelings of emersion and brain involvement. This led though to some really nice figures, one of them I liked so much that I digitized it (see the [TheNotes README](https://github.com/jadnohra/TheNotes?tab=readme-ov-file#thenotes)) and made it the symbol of my Notes collection — it is a graphical 'machine' that almost mechanistically tries to express how a Taylor series power expansion 'produces' terms.
