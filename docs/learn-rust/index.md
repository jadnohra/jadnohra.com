# Learn Rust

<p class="subtitle">A mental model for Rust's memory system — for programmers who already know C++.</p>

Rust's borrow checker has a reputation for being mysterious and combative. It isn't. It's a straightforward static analysis operating on a small set of rules. This course gives you the framework that makes it obvious.
