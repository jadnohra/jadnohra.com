## About

**446 quotes** collected during 7 years of intensive mathematical self-study (2011-2018), from the [77 Neurons Project Perelman](https://github.com/jadnohra/77-neurons-project-perelman) — a collaborative mathematics study project.

### Jad's Tag System

A personal categorization system developed during the study:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **Justif** | Philosophical justifications — quotes that justify or motivate mathematical concepts |
| **Curious** | Curious and/or prolix — interesting tangents and verbose explanations |
| **Origins** | Historical origins — where concepts actually came from (often not taught) |
| **PhilTake** | Philosophical take — less formal, zoomed-out perspectives on formal ideas |
| **AA** | The Amazing Ancients — surprisingly modern insights from ancient mathematicians |
| **IKIT** | "I Knew It!" — quotes confirming intuitions you had but couldn't articulate |
| **Sep** | Separate — reminders not to confuse mathematicians with their polished work |
| **Clueless** | Brilliant but unaware — great ideas whose importance wasn't recognized at the time |
| **Humor** | Mathematical humor |

### Topic Categories

- **Foundations** — Logic, Set Theory, Proof techniques
- **Analysis** — Calculus, Real Analysis, Measure Theory
- **Algebra** — Linear Algebra, Group Theory, Abstract Algebra
- **Geometry** — Differential Geometry, Topology, Euclidean
- **Physics** — Mechanics, Relativity, Quantum
- **Philosophy** — Nature of Math, History, Beauty
